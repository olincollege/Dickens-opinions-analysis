      "dark caves, overshadowed by the wall.  The emphasis was helped by the\n",

      "helped by the speaker’s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and\n",

      "THOMAS GRADGRIND, sir.  A man of realities.  A man of facts and\n",
      "calculations.  A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are\n",
      "four, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for\n",
      "anything over.  Thomas Gradgrind, sir—peremptorily Thomas—Thomas\n",
      "Gradgrind.  With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication\n",
      "table always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of\n",
      "human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.  It is a mere\n",
      "question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.  You might hope to get\n",
      "some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or\n",
      "Augustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all\n",
      "supposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of Thomas\n",
      "Gradgrind—no, sir!\n",
      "\n",
      "In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether\n",
      "to his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.  In\n",
      "such terms, no doubt, substituting the words ‘boys and girls,’ for ‘sir,’\n",
      "Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers\n",
      "before him, who were to be filled so full of facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before\n",
      "mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts,\n",
      "and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one\n",
      "discharge.  He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim\n",
      "mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be\n",
      "stormed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Girl number twenty,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his\n",
      "square forefinger, ‘I don’t know that girl.  Who is that girl?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sissy Jupe, sir,’ explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and\n",
      "curtseying.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sissy is not a name,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Don’t call yourself Sissy.\n",
      "Call yourself Cecilia.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s father as calls me Sissy, sir,’ returned the young girl in a\n",
      "trembling voice, and with another curtsey.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then he has no business to do it,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Tell him he\n",
      "mustn’t.  Cecilia Jupe.  Let me see.  What is your father?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We don’t want to know anything about that, here.  You mustn’t tell us\n",
      "about that, here.  Your father breaks horses, don’t he?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses\n",
      "in the ring, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You mustn’t tell us about the ring, here.  Very well, then.  Describe\n",
      "your father as a horsebreaker.  He doctors sick horses, I dare say?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh yes, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very well, then.  He is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and\n",
      "horsebreaker.  Give me your definition of a horse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, for\n",
      "the general behoof of all the little pitchers.  ‘Girl number twenty\n",
      "possessed of no facts, in reference to one of the commonest of animals!\n",
      "Some boy’s definition of a horse.  Bitzer, yours.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer,\n",
      "perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which,\n",
      "darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room,\n",
      "irradiated Sissy.  For, the boys and girls sat on the face of the\n",
      "inclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow\n",
      "interval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came\n",
      "in for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the corner\n",
      "of a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end.  But,\n",
      "whereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she seemed to\n",
      "receive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun, when it shone\n",
      "upon her, the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same\n",
      "rays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed.\n",
      "His cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of\n",
      "lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something\n",
      "paler than themselves, expressed their form.  His short-cropped hair\n",
      "might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead\n",
      "and face.  His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge,\n",
      "that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bitzer,’ said Thomas Gradgrind.  ‘Your definition of a horse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Quadruped.  Graminivorous.  Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders,\n",
      "four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive.  Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy\n",
      "countries, sheds hoofs, too.  Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with\n",
      "iron.  Age known by marks in mouth.’  Thus (and much more) Bitzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now girl number twenty,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘You know what a horse\n",
      "is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have\n",
      "blushed deeper than she had blushed all this time.  Bitzer, after rapidly\n",
      "blinking at Thomas Gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the\n",
      "light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennæ\n",
      "of busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and sat down\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third gentleman now stepped forth.  A mighty man at cutting and\n",
      "drying, he was; a government officer; in his way (and in most other\n",
      "people’s too), a professed pugilist; always in training, always with a\n",
      "system to force down the general throat like a bolus, always to be heard\n",
      "of at the bar of his little Public-office, ready to fight all England.\n",
      "To continue in fistic phraseology, he had a genius for coming up to the\n",
      "scratch, wherever and whatever it was, and proving himself an ugly\n",
      "customer.  He would go in and damage any subject whatever with his right,\n",
      "follow up with his left, stop, exchange, counter, bore his opponent (he\n",
      "always fought All England) to the ropes, and fall upon him neatly.  He\n",
      "was certain to knock the wind out of common sense, and render that\n",
      "unlucky adversary deaf to the call of time.  And he had it in charge from\n",
      "high authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium, when\n",
      "Commissioners should reign upon earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very well,’ said this gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms.\n",
      "‘That’s a horse.  Now, let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a\n",
      "room with representations of horses?’\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus, ‘Yes, sir!’\n",
      "Upon which the other half, seeing in the gentleman’s face that Yes was\n",
      "wrong, cried out in chorus, ‘No, sir!’—as the custom is, in these\n",
      "examinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course, No.  Why wouldn’t you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause.  One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing,\n",
      "ventured the answer, Because he wouldn’t paper a room at all, but would\n",
      "paint it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You _must_ paper it,’ said the gentleman, rather warmly.\n",
      "\n",

      "perch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds\n",
      "and butterflies upon your crockery.  You never meet with quadrupeds going\n",
      "up and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls.\n",
      "You must use,’ said the gentleman, ‘for all these purposes, combinations\n",

      "\n",
      "No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was up in the\n",

      "A very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was.  Not\n",

      "attached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its\n",

      "was a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a\n",
      "starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow, which brightened its\n",
      "expression.  Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with\n",
      "uncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them,\n",

      "‘_My_ mother?  Bolted, ma’am!’ said Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up.\n",

      "the best of my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the\n",
      "worst old woman that ever lived.  If I got a little pair of shoes by any\n",
      "chance, she would take ’em off and sell ’em for drink.  Why, I have known\n",
      "that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses\n",
      "of liquor before breakfast!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality,\n",
      "looked (as she always did) like an indifferently executed transparency of\n",
      "a small female figure, without enough light behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘She kept a chandler’s shop,’ pursued Bounderby, ‘and kept me in an\n",
      "egg-box.  That was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box.  As soon as I\n",
      "was big enough to run away, of course I ran away.  Then I became a young\n",
      "vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me,\n",
      "everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me.  They were right;\n",
      "they had no business to do anything else.  I was a nuisance, an\n",

      "\n",
      "His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.  Whether I was to\n",
      "do it or not, ma’am, I did it.  I pulled through it, though nobody threw\n",
      "me out a rope.  Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk,\n",
      "chief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Those are\n",
      "the antecedents, and the culmination.  Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\n",
      "learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and\n",
      "was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the\n",
      "steeple clock of St. Giles’s Church, London, under the direction of a\n",
      "drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant.\n",
      "Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your\n",
      "model schools, and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish\n",
      "of schools; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all\n",
      "right, all correct—he hadn’t such advantages—but let us have hard-headed,\n",
      "solid-fisted people—the education that made him won’t do for everybody,\n",
      "he knows well—such and such his education was, however, and you may force\n",

      "facts of his life.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Being heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\n",
      "stopped.  He stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still\n",
      "accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.  His eminently\n",
      "practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a\n",
      "reproachful look that plainly said, ‘Behold your Bounderby!’\n",
      "\n",

      "Thomas in the dumps about?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We were peeping at the circus,’ muttered Louisa, haughtily, without\n",
      "lifting up her eyes, ‘and father caught us.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And, Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said her husband in a lofty manner, ‘I should as\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Dear me,’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘How can you, Louisa and Thomas!  I\n",
      "wonder at you.  I declare you’re enough to make one regret ever having\n",
      "had a family at all.  I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn’t.  _Then_\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks.\n",

      "look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of\n",
      "circuses!’ said Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘You know, as well as I do, no young\n",
      "people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend\n",
      "lectures about circuses.  What can you possibly want to know of circuses\n",
      "then?  I am sure you have enough to do, if that’s what you want.  With my\n",

      "facts you have got to attend to.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s the reason!’ pouted Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t tell me that’s the reason, because it can’t be nothing of the\n",
      "sort,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘Go and be somethingological directly.’\n",
      "Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her\n",
      "children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their\n",
      "pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind’s stock of facts in general was woefully\n",
      "defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial\n",
      "position, had been influenced by two reasons.  Firstly, she was most\n",
      "satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had ‘no\n",
      "nonsense’ about her.  By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is\n",
      "probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human\n",
      "being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without\n",
      "collision between herself and any other fact.  So, she once more died\n",
      "away, and nobody minded her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, ‘you\n",
      "are always so interested in my young people—particularly in Louisa—that I\n",
      "make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this\n",
      "discovery.  I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the\n",
      "education of the reason of my family.  The reason is (as you know) the\n",
      "only faculty to which education should be addressed.  ‘And yet,\n",
      "Bounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day,\n",
      "though in itself a trifling one, as if something had crept into Thomas’s\n",
      "and Louisa’s minds which is—or rather, which is not—I don’t know that I\n",
      "can express myself better than by saying—which has never been intended to\n",
      "be developed, and in which their reason has no part.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of\n",
      "vagabonds,’ returned Bounderby.  ‘When I was a vagabond myself, nobody\n",
      "looked with any interest at _me_; I know that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his\n",
      "eyes on the fire, ‘in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ll tell you in what.  In idle imagination.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope not,’ said the eminently practical; ‘I confess, however, that the\n",
      "misgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In idle imagination, Gradgrind,’ repeated Bounderby.  ‘A very bad thing\n",
      "for anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa.  I should ask\n",
      "Mrs. Gradgrind’s pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very\n",
      "well I am not a refined character.  Whoever expects refinement in _me_\n",
      "will be disappointed.  I hadn’t a refined bringing up.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Whether,’ said Gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and\n",
      "his cavernous eyes on the fire, ‘whether any instructor or servant can\n",
      "have suggested anything?  Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading\n",
      "anything?  Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can\n",
      "have got into the house?  Because, in minds that have been practically\n",
      "formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so\n",
      "incomprehensible.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Stop a bit!’ cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as\n",
      "before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with\n",
      "explosive humility.  ‘You have one of those strollers’ children in the\n",
      "school.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cecilia Jupe, by name,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken\n",
      "look at his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, stop a bit!’ cried Bounderby again.  ‘How did she come there?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just\n",
      "now.  She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not\n",
      "regularly belonging to our town, and—yes, you are right, Bounderby, you\n",
      "are right.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, stop a bit!’ cried Bounderby, once more.  ‘Louisa saw her when she\n",
      "came?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me.\n",
      "But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind’s presence.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, ‘what passed?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, my poor health!’ returned Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘The girl wanted to come\n",
      "to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and\n",
      "Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr.\n",
      "Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict\n",
      "them when such was the fact!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Turn this girl to\n",
      "the right about, and there’s an end of it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am much of your opinion.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do it at once,’ said Bounderby, ‘has always been my motto from a child.\n",
      "When I thought I would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did\n",
      "it at once.  Do you the same.  Do this at once!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are you walking?’ asked his friend.  ‘I have the father’s address.\n",
      "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not the least in the world,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘as long as you do it\n",
      "at once!’\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat—he always threw it on, as expressing a\n",
      "man who had been far too busily employed in making himself, to acquire\n",
      "any fashion of wearing his hat—and with his hands in his pockets,\n",
      "sauntered out into the hall.  ‘I never wear gloves,’ it was his custom to\n",
      "say.  ‘I didn’t climb up the ladder in _them_.—Shouldn’t be so high up,\n",
      "if I had.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind\n",
      "went up-stairs for the address, he opened the door of the children’s\n",
      "study and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment, which,\n",
      "notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of\n",
      "learned and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a\n",
      "room devoted to hair-cutting.  Louisa languidly leaned upon the window\n",
      "looking out, without looking at anything, while young Thomas stood\n",
      "sniffing revengefully at the fire.  Adam Smith and Malthus, two younger\n",
      "Gradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little Jane, after\n",
      "manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with\n",
      "slate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s all right now, Louisa: it’s all right, young Thomas,’ said Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby; ‘you won’t do so any more.  I’ll answer for it’s being all\n",
      "over with father.  Well, Louisa, that’s worth a kiss, isn’t it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,’ returned Louisa, when she had coldly\n",
      "paused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her\n",
      "cheek towards him, with her face turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Always my pet; ain’t you, Louisa?’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Good-bye,\n",
      "Louisa!’\n",
      "\n",
      "He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had\n",
      "kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red.  She was still\n",
      "doing this, five minutes afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What are you about, Loo?’ her brother sulkily remonstrated.  ‘You’ll rub\n",
      "a hole in your face.’\n",
      "\n",

      "THE KEYNOTE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "COKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a\n",
      "triumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs.\n",
      "Gradgrind herself.  Let us strike the key-note, Coketown, before pursuing\n",
      "our tune.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the\n",
      "smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of\n",
      "unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage.  It was a town\n",
      "of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of\n",
      "smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.  It\n",
      "had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling\n",
      "dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a\n",
      "rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the\n",
      "steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an\n",
      "elephant in a state of melancholy madness.  It contained several large\n",
      "streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like\n",
      "one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went\n",
      "in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same\n",
      "pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as\n",
      "yesterday and to-morrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and\n",
      "the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "These attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work\n",
      "by which it was sustained; against them were to be set off, comforts of\n",
      "life which found their way all over the world, and elegancies of life\n",
      "which made, we will not ask how much of the fine lady, who could scarcely\n",
      "bear to hear the place mentioned.  The rest of its features were\n",
      "voluntary, and they were these.\n",
      "\n",
      "You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful.  If the\n",
      "members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there—as the members of\n",
      "eighteen religious persuasions had done—they made it a pious warehouse of\n",
      "red brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly ornamental\n",
      "examples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.  The solitary exception\n",
      "was the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the\n",
      "door, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs.  All\n",
      "the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe\n",
      "characters of black and white.  The jail might have been the infirmary,\n",
      "the infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been\n",
      "either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the\n",
      "contrary in the graces of their construction.  Fact, fact, fact,\n",
      "everywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact,\n",
      "everywhere in the immaterial.  The M’Choakumchild school was all fact,\n",
      "and the school of design was all fact, and the relations between master\n",
      "and man were all fact, and everything was fact between the lying-in\n",
      "hospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn’t state in figures, or\n",
      "show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the\n",
      "dearest, was not, and never should be, world without end, Amen.\n",
      "\n",
      "A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course\n",
      "got on well?  Why no, not quite well.  No?  Dear me!\n",
      "\n",
      "No.  Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like\n",
      "gold that had stood the fire.  First, the perplexing mystery of the place\n",
      "was, Who belonged to the eighteen denominations?  Because, whoever did,\n",
      "the labouring people did not.  It was very strange to walk through the\n",
      "streets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of _them_ the barbarous\n",
      "jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away\n",
      "from their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of\n",
      "their own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the\n",
      "church and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of\n",
      "concern.  Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this, because there\n",
      "was a native organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be\n",
      "heard of in the House of Commons every session, indignantly petitioning\n",
      "for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main\n",
      "force.  Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained that these same\n",
      "people _would_ get drunk, and showed in tabular statements that they did\n",
      "get drunk, and proved at tea parties that no inducement, human or Divine\n",
      "(except a medal), would induce them to forego their custom of getting\n",
      "drunk.  Then came the chemist and druggist, with other tabular\n",
      "statements, showing that when they didn’t get drunk, they took opium.\n",
      "Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more tabular\n",
      "statements, outdoing all the previous tabular statements, and showing\n",
      "that the same people _would_ resort to low haunts, hidden from the public\n",
      "eye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined\n",
      "in it; and where A. B., aged twenty-four next birthday, and committed for\n",
      "eighteen months’ solitary, had himself said (not that he had ever shown\n",
      "himself particularly worthy of belief) his ruin began, as he was\n",
      "perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip-top\n",
      "moral specimen.  Then came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby, the two\n",
      "gentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown, and both\n",
      "eminently practical, who could, on occasion, furnish more tabular\n",
      "statements derived from their own personal experience, and illustrated by\n",
      "cases they had known and seen, from which it clearly appeared—in short,\n",
      "it was the only clear thing in the case—that these same people were a bad\n",
      "lot altogether, gentlemen; that do what you would for them they were\n",
      "never thankful for it, gentlemen; that they were restless, gentlemen;\n",
      "that they never knew what they wanted; that they lived upon the best, and\n",
      "bought fresh butter; and insisted on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but\n",
      "prime parts of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and\n",
      "unmanageable.  In short, it was the moral of the old nursery fable:\n",
      "\n",
      "    There was an old woman, and what do you think?\n",
      "    She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;\n",
      "    Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,\n",
      "    And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy between the case of\n",
      "the Coketown population and the case of the little Gradgrinds?  Surely,\n",
      "none of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures, are to be\n",
      "told at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements in the\n",
      "existence of the Coketown working-people had been for scores of years,\n",
      "deliberately set at nought?  That there was any Fancy in them demanding\n",
      "to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in\n",
      "convulsions?  That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and\n",
      "monotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical relief—some\n",
      "relaxation, encouraging good humour and good spirits, and giving them a\n",
      "vent—some recognized holiday, though it were but for an honest dance to a\n",
      "stirring band of music—some occasional light pie in which even\n",
      "M’Choakumchild had no finger—which craving must and would be satisfied\n",

      "Girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a curtsey.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why are you tearing about the streets,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘in this\n",
      "improper manner?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I was—I was run after, sir,’ the girl panted, ‘and I wanted to get\n",
      "away.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Run after?’ repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Who would run after _you_?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the\n",
      "colourless boy, Bitzer, who came round the corner with such blind speed\n",
      "and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought\n",
      "himself up against Mr. Gradgrind’s waistcoat and rebounded into the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you mean, boy?’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘What are you doing?  How\n",
      "dare you dash against—everybody—in this manner?’  Bitzer picked up his\n",
      "cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his\n",
      "forehead, pleaded that it was an accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Was this boy running after you, Jupe?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir,’ said the girl reluctantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, I wasn’t, sir!’ cried Bitzer.  ‘Not till she run away from me.  But\n",
      "the horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; they’re famous for it.\n",
      "You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say,’\n",
      "addressing Sissy.  ‘It’s as well known in the town as—please, sir, as the\n",
      "multiplication table isn’t known to the horse-riders.’  Bitzer tried Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He frightened me so,’ said the girl, ‘with his cruel faces!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh!’ cried Bitzer.  ‘Oh!  An’t you one of the rest!  An’t you a\n",
      "horse-rider!  I never looked at her, sir.  I asked her if she would know\n",
      "how to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to tell her again, and she\n",
      "ran away, and I ran after her, sir, that she might know how to answer\n",
      "when she was asked.  You wouldn’t have thought of saying such mischief if\n",
      "you hadn’t been a horse-rider?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Her calling seems to be pretty well known among ’em,’ observed Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby.  ‘You’d have had the whole school peeping in a row, in a\n",
      "week.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Truly, I think so,’ returned his friend.  ‘Bitzer, turn you about and\n",
      "take yourself home. Jupe, stay here a moment.  Let me hear of your\n",
      "running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the\n",
      "master of the school.  You understand what I mean.  Go along.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again,\n",
      "glanced at Sissy, turned about, and retreated.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, girl,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘take this gentleman and me to your\n",
      "father’s; we are going there.  What have you got in that bottle you are\n",
      "carrying?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Gin,’ said Mr. Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dear, no, sir!  It’s the nine oils.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The what?’ cried Mr. Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The nine oils, sir, to rub father with.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then,’ said Mr. Bounderby, with a loud short laugh, ‘what the devil do\n",
      "you rub your father with nine oils for?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s what our people aways use, sir, when they get any hurts in the\n",

      "that her pursuer was gone.  ‘They bruise themselves very bad sometimes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Serve ’em right,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘for being idle.’  She glanced up\n",
      "at his face, with mingled astonishment and dread.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘By George!’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘when I was four or five years younger\n",
      "than you, I had worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty\n",
      "oils, would have rubbed off.  I didn’t get ’em by posture-making, but by\n",
      "being banged about.  There was no rope-dancing for me; I danced on the\n",
      "bare ground and was larruped with the rope.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby.  His character was not unkind, all things considered; it might\n",
      "have been a very kind one indeed, if he had only made some round mistake\n",
      "in the arithmetic that balanced it, years ago.  He said, in what he meant\n",
      "for a reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, ‘And this is\n",
      "Pod’s End; is it, Jupe?’\n",

      "dim red lights in it.  As haggard and as shabby, as if, for want of\n",

      "drunkards go, and was very near the end of it.\n",
      "\n",

      "hear a dog, sir, it’s only Merrylegs, and he only barks.’\n",
      "\n",

      "THE name of the public-house was the Pegasus’s Arms.  The Pegasus’s legs\n",
      "might have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse\n",
      "upon the sign-board, the Pegasus’s Arms was inscribed in Roman letters.\n",
      "Beneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll, the painter had\n",

      "\n",
      "As it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it had not\n",
      "grown light enough within to see the picture, Mr. Gradgrind and Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby received no offence from these idealities.  They followed the\n",
      "girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in\n",
      "the dark while she went on for a candle.  They expected every moment to\n",
      "hear Merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not\n",
      "barked when the girl and the candle appeared together.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Father is not in our room, sir,’ she said, with a face of great\n",
      "surprise.  ‘If you wouldn’t mind walking in, I’ll find him directly.’\n",
      "They walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for them, sped away with\n",
      "a quick light step.  It was a mean, shabbily furnished room, with a bed\n",
      "in it.  The white night-cap, embellished with two peacock’s feathers and\n",
      "a pigtail bolt upright, in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon\n",
      "enlivened the varied performances with his chaste Shaksperean quips and\n",
      "retorts, hung upon a nail; but no other portion of his wardrobe, or other\n",
      "token of himself or his pursuits, was to be seen anywhere.  As to\n",
      "Merrylegs, that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who\n",
      "went aboard the ark, might have been accidentally shut out of it, for any\n",
      "sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the Pegasus’s Arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "They heard the doors of rooms above, opening and shutting as Sissy went\n",
      "from one to another in quest of her father; and presently they heard\n",
      "voices expressing surprise.  She came bounding down again in a great\n",
      "hurry, opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk, found it empty, and\n",
      "looked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Father must have gone down to the Booth, sir.  I don’t know why he\n",
      "should go there, but he must be there; I’ll bring him in a minute!’  She\n",
      "was gone directly, without her bonnet; with her long, dark, childish hair\n",
      "streaming behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What does she mean!’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Back in a minute?  It’s more\n",

      "Before Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the door, and\n",
      "introducing himself with the words, ‘By your leaves, gentlemen!’ walked\n",
      "in with his hands in his pockets.  His face, close-shaven, thin, and\n",
      "sallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed into a roll\n",
      "all round his head, and parted up the centre.  His legs were very robust,\n",
      "but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been.  His chest\n",
      "and back were as much too broad, as his legs were too short.  He was\n",
      "dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl\n",
      "round his neck; smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses’ provender,\n",
      "and sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded of\n",
      "the stable and the play-house.  Where the one began, and the other ended,\n",
      "nobody could have told with any precision.  This gentleman was mentioned\n",
      "in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers, so justly celebrated\n",
      "for his daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American\n",
      "Prairies; in which popular performance, a diminutive boy with an old\n",
      "face, who now accompanied him, assisted as his infant son: being carried\n",
      "upside down over his father’s shoulder, by one foot, and held by the\n",
      "crown of his head, heels upwards, in the palm of his father’s hand,\n",
      "according to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be\n",
      "observed to fondle their offspring.  Made up with curls, wreaths, wings,\n",
      "white bismuth, and carmine, this hopeful young person soared into so\n",
      "pleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part\n",
      "of the spectators; but in private, where his characteristics were a\n",
      "precocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice, he became of the\n",
      "Turf, turfy.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘By your leaves, gentlemen,’ said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, glancing round\n",

      "\n",
      "‘It was,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘His daughter has gone to fetch him, but I\n",

      "the value of time.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have not,’ retorted Mr. Childers, after surveying him from head to\n",
      "foot, ‘the honour of knowing _you_,—but if you mean that you can make\n",
      "more money of your time than I can of mine, I should judge from your\n",

      "‘What does he come here cheeking us for, then?’ cried Master\n",

      "cheek us, pay your ochre at the doors and take it out.’\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Missed his tip.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never done ’em once,’\n",
      "said Master Kidderminster.  ‘Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was\n",
      "loose in his ponging.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Didn’t do what he ought to do.  Was short in his leaps and bad in his\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Oh!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that is tip, is it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In a general way that’s missing his tip,’ Mr. E. W. B. Childers\n",
      "answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and Ponging, eh!’\n",
      "ejaculated Bounderby, with his laugh of laughs.  ‘Queer sort of company,\n",
      "too, for a man who has raised himself!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Lower yourself, then,’ retorted Cupid.  ‘Oh Lord! if you’ve raised\n",
      "yourself so high as all that comes to, let yourself down a bit.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is a very obtrusive lad!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, turning, and knitting\n",
      "his brows on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We’d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were\n",
      "coming,’ retorted Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed.  ‘It’s a pity\n",
      "you don’t have a bespeak, being so particular.  You’re on the Tight-Jeff,\n",
      "ain’t you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What does this unmannerly boy mean,’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, eyeing him in\n",
      "a sort of desperation, ‘by Tight-Jeff?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There!  Get out, get out!’ said Mr. Childers, thrusting his young friend\n",
      "from the room, rather in the prairie manner.  ‘Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff,\n",
      "it don’t much signify: it’s only tight-rope and slack-rope.  You were\n",
      "going to give me a message for Jupe?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, I was.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then,’ continued Mr. Childers, quickly, ‘my opinion is, he will never\n",
      "receive it.  Do you know much of him?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I never saw the man in my life.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I doubt if you ever _will_ see him now.  It’s pretty plain to me, he’s\n",
      "off.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ay!  I mean,’ said Mr. Childers, with a nod, ‘that he has cut.  He was\n",
      "goosed last night, he was goosed the night before last, he was goosed\n",
      "to-day.  He has lately got in the way of being always goosed, and he\n",
      "can’t stand it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why has he been—so very much—Goosed?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the\n",
      "word out of himself, with great solemnity and reluctance.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up,’ said Childers.\n",
      "‘He has his points as a Cackler still, but he can’t get a living out of\n",
      "_them_.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A Cackler!’ Bounderby repeated.  ‘Here we go again!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,’ said Mr. E. W. B.\n",
      "Childers, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder,\n",
      "and accompanying it with a shake of his long hair—which all shook at\n",
      "once.  ‘Now, it’s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to\n",
      "know that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with\n",
      "it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good!’ interrupted Mr. Bounderby.  ‘This is good, Gradgrind!  A man so\n",
      "fond of his daughter, that he runs away from her!  This is devilish good!\n",
      "Ha! ha!  Now, I’ll tell you what, young man.  I haven’t always occupied\n",
      "my present station of life.  I know what these things are.  You may be\n",
      "astonished to hear it, but my mother—ran away from _me_.’\n",
      "\n",
      "E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to\n",
      "hear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very well,’ said Bounderby.  ‘I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran\n",
      "away from me.  Do I excuse her for it?  No.  Have I ever excused her for\n",
      "it?  Not I.  What do I call her for it?  I call her probably the very\n",
      "worst woman that ever lived in the world, except my drunken grandmother.\n",
      "There’s no family pride about me, there’s no imaginative sentimental\n",
      "humbug about me.  I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah\n",
      "Bounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour, what I should call\n",
      "her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping.  So, with this\n",
      "man.  He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond, that’s what he is, in\n",
      "English.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s all the same to me what he is or what he is not, whether in English\n",
      "or whether in French,’ retorted Mr. E. W. B. Childers, facing about.  ‘I\n",
      "am telling your friend what’s the fact; if you don’t like to hear it, you\n",
      "can avail yourself of the open air.  You give it mouth enough, you do;\n",
      "but give it mouth in your own building at least,’ remonstrated E. W. B.\n",
      "with stern irony.  ‘Don’t give it mouth in this building, till you’re\n",
      "called upon.  You have got some building of your own I dare say, now?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps so,’ replied Mr. Bounderby, rattling his money and laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if you please?’ said\n",
      "Childers.  ‘Because this isn’t a strong building, and too much of you\n",
      "might bring it down!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again, he turned from him, as from\n",
      "a man finally disposed of, to Mr. Gradgrind.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was\n",
      "seen to slip out himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied\n",
      "up in a handkerchief under his arm.  She will never believe it of him,\n",
      "but he has cut away and left her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pray,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘why will she never believe it of him?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Because those two were one.  Because they were never asunder.  Because,\n",
      "up to this time, he seemed to dote upon her,’ said Childers, taking a\n",
      "step or two to look into the empty trunk.  Both Mr. Childers and Master\n",
      "Kidderminster walked in a curious manner; with their legs wider apart\n",
      "than the general run of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being\n",
      "stiff in the knees.  This walk was common to all the male members of\n",
      "Sleary’s company, and was understood to express, that they were always on\n",
      "horseback.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Poor Sissy!  He had better have apprenticed her,’ said Childers, giving\n",
      "his hair another shake, as he looked up from the empty box.  ‘Now, he\n",
      "leaves her without anything to take to.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express\n",
      "that opinion,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind, approvingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_I_ never apprenticed?  I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh!  Indeed?’ said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been\n",
      "defrauded of his good opinion.  ‘I was not aware of its being the custom\n",
      "to apprentice young persons to—’\n",
      "\n",

      "unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby’s existence, ‘that she was to be taught\n",

      "can only say that it never got out.  He has been picking up a bit of\n",

      "ciphering for her, somewhere else—these seven years.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets, stroked\n",
      "his face and chin, and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little\n",
      "hope, at Mr. Gradgrind.  From the first he had sought to conciliate that\n",

      "\n",
      "‘When Sissy got into the school here,’ he pursued, ‘her father was as\n",
      "pleased as Punch.  I couldn’t altogether make out why, myself, as we were\n",
      "not stationary here, being but comers and goers anywhere.  I suppose,\n",
      "however, he had this move in his mind—he was always half-cracked—and then\n",
      "considered her provided for.  If you should happen to have looked in\n",
      "to-night, for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her\n",
      "any little service,’ said Mr. Childers, stroking his face again, and\n",
      "repeating his look, ‘it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very\n",
      "fortunate and well-timed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘On the contrary,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘I came to tell him that her\n",

      "connivance on her part—Bounderby, let me have a word with you.’\n",

      "Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian\n",

      "and softly whistling.  While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby’s voice as ‘No.  _I_ say no.  I advise you not.  I say by\n",
      "no means.’  While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone\n",
      "the words, ‘But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which\n",

      "gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  There were two or\n",
      "three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands,\n",
      "and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children,\n",
      "who did the fairy business when required.  The father of one of the\n",
      "families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the\n",
      "families on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often\n",
      "made a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the\n",
      "apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling\n",
      "casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins,\n",
      "ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.  All the\n",
      "mothers could (and did) dance, upon the slack wire and the tight-rope,\n",
      "and perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds; none of them were at all\n",
      "particular in respect of showing their legs; and one of them, alone in a\n",
      "Greek chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came to.  They all\n",
      "assumed to be mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their\n",
      "private dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic\n",
      "arrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company would have\n",
      "produced but a poor letter on any subject.  Yet there was a remarkable\n",
      "gentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for\n",

      "MR. BOUNDERBY being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his\n",

      "Scadgers.  Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom she was the relict, had been by\n",
      "the mother’s side what Mrs. Sparsit still called ‘a Powler.’  Strangers\n",
      "of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not\n",
      "to know what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might\n",
      "be a business, or a political party, or a profession of faith.  The\n",
      "better class of minds, however, did not need to be informed that the\n",
      "Powlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly\n",
      "far back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost\n",
      "themselves—which they had rather frequently done, as respected\n",
      "horse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the\n",

      "fat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcher’s meat, and a\n",
      "mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen\n",

      "and chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long\n",
      "slim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.  He inherited a\n",
      "fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and\n",
      "spent it twice over immediately afterwards.  Thus, when he died, at\n",
      "twenty-four (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he\n",
      "did not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the\n",
      "honeymoon, in affluent circumstances.  That bereaved lady, fifteen years\n",
      "older than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, Lady\n",
      "Scadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain\n",
      "herself, went out at a salary.  And here she was now, in her elderly\n",
      "days, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows\n",

      "enough of it, first and last!  He’d open his eyes, that boy would, if he\n",
      "knew how empty of learning _my_ young maw was, at his time of life.’\n",
      "Which, by the by, he probably did know, for he had heard of it often\n",

      "the mud of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize in the\n",

      "when I hadn’t a penny to buy a link to light you.’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Egad, ma’am, so was I,’ said Bounderby, ‘—with the wrong side of it.  A\n",

      "learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life.  If I have\n",
      "acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences, and can\n",
      "scarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit for that, since I believe\n",
      "it is a general sentiment.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am,’ said her patron, ‘perhaps some people may be pleased to\n",
      "say that they do like to hear, in his own unpolished way, what Josiah\n",
      "Bounderby, of Coketown, has gone through.  But you must confess that you\n",

      "the very opposite of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,’ said Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon\n",
      "her.  ‘It is unquestionably true.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs\n",
      "in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud.  Mr. and Miss Gradgrind\n",

      "and the latter with a kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?’ asked Mr. Gradgrind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.  So Jupe was sent there.  On coming in, she curtseyed to Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby, and to his friend Tom Gradgrind, and also to Louisa; but in\n",
      "her confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit.  Observing this, the\n",
      "blustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, I tell you what, my girl.  The name of that lady by the teapot, is\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit.  That lady acts as mistress of this house, and she is a\n",
      "highly connected lady.  Consequently, if ever you come again into any\n",
      "room in this house, you will make a short stay in it if you don’t behave\n",
      "towards that lady in your most respectful manner.  Now, I don’t care a\n",
      "button what you do to _me_, because I don’t affect to be anybody.  So far\n",
      "from having high connections I have no connections at all, and I come of\n",
      "the scum of the earth.  But towards that lady, I do care what you do; and\n",
      "you shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not come\n",
      "here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope, Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, in a conciliatory voice, ‘that\n",
      "this was merely an oversight.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests, Mrs. Sparsit,’ said Bounderby, ‘that\n",
      "this was merely an oversight.  Very likely.  However, as you are aware,\n",
      "ma’am, I don’t allow of even oversights towards you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are very good indeed, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head\n",
      "with her State humility.  ‘It is not worth speaking of.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in\n",
      "her eyes, was now waved over by the master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind.\n",
      "She stood looking intently at him, and Louisa stood coldly by, with her\n",
      "eyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you\n",
      "are not in attendance at the school, to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind,\n",
      "who is rather an invalid.  I have explained to Miss Louisa—this is Miss\n",
      "Louisa—the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to\n",
      "expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not\n",
      "to be referred to any more.  From this time you begin your history.  You\n",
      "are, at present, ignorant, I know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir, very,’ she answered, curtseying.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated;\n",
      "and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with\n",
      "you, of the advantages of the training you will receive.  You will be\n",
      "reclaimed and formed.  You have been in the habit now of reading to your\n",
      "father, and those people I found you among, I dare say?’ said Mr.\n",
      "Gradgrind, beckoning her nearer to him before he said so, and dropping\n",
      "his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Only to father and Merrylegs, sir.  At least I mean to father, when\n",
      "Merrylegs was always there.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, with a passing frown.\n",
      "‘I don’t ask about him.  I understand you to have been in the habit of\n",
      "reading to your father?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O, yes, sir, thousands of times.  They were the happiest—O, of all the\n",
      "happy times we had together, sir!’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only now when her sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what,’ asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower voice, ‘did you read to\n",
      "your father, Jupe?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the Hunchback, and the\n",
      "Genies,’ she sobbed out; ‘and about—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hush!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that is enough.  Never breathe a word of\n",
      "such destructive nonsense any more.  Bounderby, this is a case for rigid\n",
      "training, and I shall observe it with interest.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well,’ returned Mr. Bounderby, ‘I have given you my opinion already, and\n",
      "I shouldn’t do as you do.  But, very well, very well.  Since you are bent\n",
      "upon it, _very_ well!’\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to\n",
      "Stone Lodge, and on the way Louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.\n",
      "And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits.  And Mrs. Sparsit got\n",

      "\n",
      "Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the\n",

      "multiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never\n",

      "more.  These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about\n",

      "one another’s faces and pulled one another’s hair by way of agreeing on\n",
      "the steps to be taken for their improvement—which they never did; a\n",
      "surprising circumstance, when the happy adaptation of the means to the\n",

      "particular, conceivable and inconceivable (especially inconceivable),\n",
      "they were pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were\n",

      "dreary pretences of being droll (when it was very melancholy indeed),\n",

      "There was a library in Coketown, to which general access was easy.  Mr.\n",

      "got to any depth in and came up sane.  It was a disheartening\n",
      "circumstance, but a melancholy fact, that even these readers persisted in\n",
      "wondering.  They wondered about human nature, human passions, human hopes\n",
      "and fears, the struggles, triumphs and defeats, the cares and joys and\n",
      "sorrows, the lives and deaths of common men and women!  They sometimes,\n",
      "after fifteen hours’ work, sat down to read mere fables about men and\n",
      "women, more or less like themselves, and about children, more or less\n",
      "like their own.  They took De Foe to their bosoms, instead of Euclid, and\n",
      "seemed to be on the whole more comforted by Goldsmith than by Cocker.\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind was for ever working, in print and out of print, at this\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I am sick of my life, Loo.  I, hate it altogether, and I hate everybody\n",

      "\n",
      "SISSY JUPE had not an easy time of it, between Mr. M’Choakumchild and\n",
      "Mrs. Gradgrind, and was not without strong impulses, in the first months\n",
      "of her probation, to run away.  It hailed facts all day long so very\n",
      "hard, and life in general was opened to her as such a closely ruled\n",
      "ciphering-book, that assuredly she would have run away, but for only one\n",
      "restraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the result of no\n",
      "arithmetical process, was self-imposed in defiance of all calculation,\n",
      "and went dead against any table of probabilities that any Actuary would\n",
      "have drawn up from the premises.  The girl believed that her father had\n",
      "not deserted her; she lived in the hope that he would come back, and in\n",
      "the faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she\n",
      "was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation,\n",
      "rejecting the superior comfort of knowing, on a sound arithmetical basis,\n",
      "that her father was an unnatural vagabond, filled Mr. Gradgrind with\n",
      "pity.  Yet, what was to be done?  M’Choakumchild reported that she had a\n",
      "very dense head for figures; that, once possessed with a general idea of\n",
      "the globe, she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact\n",
      "measurements; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates,\n",
      "unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith; that she\n",
      "would burst into tears on being required (by the mental process)\n",
      "immediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps\n",
      "at fourteen-pence halfpenny; that she was as low down, in the school, as\n",
      "low could be; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of\n",
      "Political Economy, she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler\n",
      "three feet high, for returning to the question, ‘What is the first\n",
      "principle of this science?’ the absurd answer, ‘To do unto others as I\n",
      "would that they should do unto me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all this was very bad;\n",
      "that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of\n",
      "knowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book, report, and tabular\n",
      "statements A to Z; and that Jupe ‘must be kept to it.’  So Jupe was kept\n",
      "to it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It would be a fine thing to be you, Miss Louisa!’ she said, one night,\n",

      "‘You might not be the better for it, Sissy.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, ‘I should not be the worse,\n",
      "Miss Louisa.’  To which Miss Louisa answered, ‘I don’t know that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been so little communication between these two—both because\n",
      "life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery\n",
      "which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition\n",
      "relative to Sissy’s past career—that they were still almost strangers.\n",
      "Sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa’s face, was\n",
      "uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can\n",

      "was a prosperous nation or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or\n",
      "not, unless I knew who had got the money, and whether any of it was mine.\n",
      "But that had nothing to do with it.  It was not in the figures at all,’\n",
      "said Sissy, wiping her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That was a great mistake of yours,’ observed Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now.  Then Mr. M’Choakumchild said he\n",

      "in it there are a million of inhabitants, and only five-and-twenty are\n",
      "starved to death in the streets, in the course of a year.  What is your\n",
      "remark on that proportion?  And my remark was—for I couldn’t think of a\n",
      "better one—that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were\n",
      "starved, whether the others were a million, or a million million.  And\n",
      "that was wrong, too.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course it was.’\n",
      "\n",

      "Here are the stutterings—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Statistics,’ said Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, Miss Louisa—they always remind me of stutterings, and that’s\n",
      "another of my mistakes—of accidents upon the sea.  And I find (Mr.\n",
      "M’Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went\n",
      "to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or\n",
      "burnt to death.  What is the percentage?  And I said, Miss;’ here Sissy\n",
      "fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest\n",

      "‘Nothing, Sissy?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing, Miss—to the relations and friends of the people who were\n",

      "that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I\n",
      "am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don’t like\n",
      "it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed\n",
      "before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face.  Then she\n",
      "asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well\n",
      "taught too, Sissy?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that\n",
      "they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, ‘No one hears\n",
      "us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an\n",
      "innocent question.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, Miss Louisa,’ answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her\n",
      "head; ‘father knows very little indeed.  It’s as much as he can do to\n",
      "write; and it’s more than people in general can do to read his writing.\n",
      "Though it’s plain to _me_.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your mother?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Father says she was quite a scholar.  She died when I was born.  She\n",
      "was;’ Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; ‘she was a\n",
      "dancer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did your father love her?’  Louisa asked these questions with a strong,\n",
      "wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a\n",
      "banished creature, and hiding in solitary places.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O yes!  As dearly as he loves me.  Father loved me, first, for her sake.\n",
      "He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby.  We have never been\n",
      "asunder from that time.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Only for my good.  Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I\n",
      "do.  When he left me for my good—he never would have left me for his\n",
      "own—I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial.  He will not be\n",
      "happy for a single minute, till he comes back.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tell me more about him,’ said Louisa, ‘I will never ask you again.\n",
      "Where did you live?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in.\n",
      "Father’s a;’ Sissy whispered the awful word, ‘a clown.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To make the people laugh?’ said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes.  But they wouldn’t laugh sometimes, and then father cried.  Lately,\n",
      "they very often wouldn’t laugh, and he used to come home despairing.\n",
      "Father’s not like most.  Those who didn’t know him as well as I do, and\n",
      "didn’t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right.\n",
      "Sometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt\n",
      "them, and shrunk up, when he was alone with me.  He was far, far timider\n",
      "than they thought!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And you were his comfort through everything?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She nodded, with the tears rolling down her face.  ‘I hope so, and father\n",
      "said I was.  It was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because\n",
      "he felt himself to be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to\n",
      "be his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be\n",
      "different from him.  I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he\n",
      "was very fond of that.  They were wrong books—I am never to speak of them\n",
      "here—but we didn’t know there was any harm in them.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And he liked them?’ said Louisa, with a searching gaze on Sissy all this\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O very much!  They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm.\n",
      "And often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in\n",
      "wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or\n",
      "would have her head cut off before it was finished.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And your father was always kind?  To the last?’ asked Louisa\n",
      "contravening the great principle, and wondering very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Always, always!’ returned Sissy, clasping her hands.  ‘Kinder and kinder\n",
      "than I can tell.  He was angry only one night, and that was not to me,\n",
      "but Merrylegs.  Merrylegs;’ she whispered the awful fact; ‘is his\n",
      "performing dog.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why was he angry with the dog?’ Louisa demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to\n",
      "jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them—which is one\n",
      "of his tricks.  He looked at father, and didn’t do it at once.\n",
      "Everything of father’s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn’t pleased\n",
      "the public at all.  He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing,\n",
      "and had no compassion on him.  Then he beat the dog, and I was\n",
      "frightened, and said, “Father, father!  Pray don’t hurt the creature who\n",
      "is so fond of you!  O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!”  And he stopped,\n",
      "and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the\n",
      "dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her\n",
      "hand, and sat down beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy.  Now that I have\n",
      "asked you so much, tell me the end.  The blame, if there is any blame, is\n",
      "mine, not yours.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dear Miss Louisa,’ said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; ‘I\n",
      "came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come\n",
      "home too, from the booth.  And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as\n",
      "if he was in pain.  And I said, “Have you hurt yourself, father?” (as he\n",
      "did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, “A little, my darling.”\n",
      "And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was\n",
      "crying.  The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first\n",
      "he shook all over, and said nothing but “My darling;” and “My love!”’\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not\n",
      "particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much\n",
      "of that at present.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,’ observed his sister.  ‘You have\n",
      "no occasion to go away; but don’t interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! very well!’ returned Tom.  ‘Only father has brought old Bounderby\n",
      "home, and I want you to come into the drawing-room.  Because if you come,\n",
      "there’s a good chance of old Bounderby’s asking me to dinner; and if you\n",

      "body to and fro, and making gestures with her unnerved arm, which seemed\n",

      "\n",

      "right hand of his, as if he gave everything to the four winds, ‘’_tis_ a\n",
      "muddle.  ’Tis just a muddle a’toogether, an’ the sooner I am dead, the\n",
      "better.’\n",

      "(Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pooh, pooh!  Don’t you talk nonsense, my good fellow,’ said Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby, ‘about things you don’t understand; and don’t you call the\n",
      "Institutions of your country a muddle, or you’ll get yourself into a real\n",
      "muddle one of these fine mornings.  The institutions of your country are\n",
      "not your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind\n",
      "your piece-work.  You didn’t take your wife for fast and for loose; but\n",
      "for better for worse.  If she has turned out worse—why, all we have got\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Now, I’ll tell you what!’ Mr. Bounderby resumed, as a valedictory\n",
      "address.  ‘With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions, you have been\n",
      "quite shocking this lady: who, as I have already told you, is a born\n",
      "lady, and who, as I have not already told you, has had her own marriage\n",
      "misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds—tens of Thousands\n",
      "of Pounds!’ (he repeated it with great relish).  ‘Now, you have always\n",
      "been a steady Hand hitherto; but my opinion is, and so I tell you\n",
      "plainly, that you are turning into the wrong road.  You have been\n",
      "listening to some mischievous stranger or other—they’re always about—and\n",
      "the best thing you can do is, to come out of that.  Now you know;’ here\n",
      "his countenance expressed marvellous acuteness; ‘I can see as far into a\n",
      "grindstone as another man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because I\n",
      "had my nose well kept to it when I was young.  I see traces of the turtle\n",
      "soup, and venison, and gold spoon in this.  Yes, I do!’ cried Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen said,\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir, I wish you good day.’  So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling\n",
      "at his own portrait on the wall, as if he were going to explode himself\n",
      "into it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "OLD STEPHEN descended the two white steps, shutting the black door with\n",
      "the brazen door-plate, by the aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he\n",
      "gave a parting polish with the sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot\n",
      "hand clouded it.  He crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the\n",
      "ground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he felt a touch upon\n",
      "his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not the touch he needed most at such a moment—the touch that could\n",
      "calm the wild waters of his soul, as the uplifted hand of the sublimest\n",
      "love and patience could abate the raging of the sea—yet it was a woman’s\n",
      "hand too.  It was an old woman, tall and shapely still, though withered\n",
      "by time, on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned.  She was very\n",
      "cleanly and plainly dressed, had country mud upon her shoes, and was\n",
      "newly come from a journey.  The flutter of her manner, in the unwonted\n",
      "noise of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the\n",
      "heavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves, to\n",
      "which her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country,\n",
      "in her plain holiday clothes, come into Coketown on an expedition of rare\n",
      "occurrence.  Remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation of\n",
      "his class, Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face—his face, which,\n",
      "like the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes\n",
      "and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the\n",
      "concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the\n",
      "deaf—the better to hear what she asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pray, sir,’ said the old woman, ‘didn’t I see you come out of that\n",
      "gentleman’s house?’ pointing back to Mr. Bounderby’s.  ‘I believe it was\n",
      "you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, missus,’ returned Stephen, ‘it were me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you—you’ll excuse an old woman’s curiosity—have you seen the\n",
      "gentleman?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, missus.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And how did he look, sir?  Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?’\n",
      "As she straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her\n",
      "action to her words, the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old\n",
      "woman before, and had not quite liked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O yes,’ he returned, observing her more attentively, ‘he were all that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And healthy,’ said the old woman, ‘as the fresh wind?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ returned Stephen.  ‘He were ett’n and drinking—as large and as\n",
      "loud as a Hummobee.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you!’ said the old woman, with infinite content.  ‘Thank you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "He certainly never had seen this old woman before.  Yet there was a vague\n",
      "remembrance in his mind, as if he had more than once dreamed of some old\n",
      "woman like her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked along at his side, and, gently accommodating himself to her\n",
      "humour, he said Coketown was a busy place, was it not?  To which she\n",
      "answered ‘Eigh sure!  Dreadful busy!’  Then he said, she came from the\n",
      "country, he saw?  To which she answered in the affirmative.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘By Parliamentary, this morning.  I came forty mile by Parliamentary this\n",
      "morning, and I’m going back the same forty mile this afternoon.  I walked\n",
      "nine mile to the station this morning, and if I find nobody on the road\n",
      "to give me a lift, I shall walk the nine mile back to-night.  That’s\n",
      "pretty well, sir, at my age!’ said the chatty old woman, her eye\n",
      "brightening with exultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘’Deed ’tis.  Don’t do’t too often, missus.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, no.  Once a year,’ she answered, shaking her head.  ‘I spend my\n",
      "savings so, once every year.  I come regular, to tramp about the streets,\n",
      "and see the gentlemen.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Only to see ’em?’ returned Stephen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s enough for me,’ she replied, with great earnestness and interest\n",
      "of manner.  ‘I ask no more!  I have been standing about, on this side of\n",
      "the way, to see that gentleman,’ turning her head back towards Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby’s again, ‘come out.  But, he’s late this year, and I have not\n",
      "seen him.  You came out instead.  Now, if I am obliged to go back without\n",
      "a glimpse of him—I only want a glimpse—well!  I have seen you, and you\n",
      "have seen him, and I must make that do.’  Saying this, she looked at\n",
      "Stephen as if to fix his features in her mind, and her eye was not so\n",
      "bright as it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a large allowance for difference of tastes, and with all submission\n",
      "to the patricians of Coketown, this seemed so extraordinary a source of\n",
      "interest to take so much trouble about, that it perplexed him.  But they\n",
      "were passing the church now, and as his eye caught the clock, he\n",
      "quickened his pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was going to his work? the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite\n",
      "easily.  Yes, time was nearly out.  On his telling her where he worked,\n",
      "the old woman became a more singular old woman than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘An’t you happy?’ she asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why—there’s awmost nobbody but has their troubles, missus.’  He answered\n",
      "evasively, because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he\n",
      "would be very happy indeed, and he had not the heart to disappoint her.\n",
      "He knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the old woman\n",
      "had lived so long, and could count upon his having so little, why so much\n",
      "the better for her, and none the worse for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ay, ay!  You have your troubles at home, you mean?’ she said.\n",

      "‘Times.  Just now and then,’ he answered, slightly.\n",

      "voices of the day (his own included) saying what had been really said.\n",
      "Even this imperfect consciousness faded away at last, and he dreamed a\n",
      "long, troubled dream.\n",

      "whom he knew to be living, and many whom he knew to be dead, darkness\n",
      "came on, succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light.  It broke from\n",
      "one line in the table of commandments at the altar, and illuminated the\n",
      "building with the words.  They were sounded through the church, too, as\n",
      "if there were voices in the fiery letters.  Upon this, the whole\n",
      "appearance before him and around him changed, and nothing was left as it\n",
      "had been, but himself and the clergyman.  They stood in the daylight\n",
      "before a crowd so vast, that if all the people in the world could have\n",
      "been brought together into one space, they could not have looked, he\n",
      "thought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him, and there was not one\n",
      "pitying or friendly eye among the millions that were fastened on his\n",
      "face.  He stood on a raised stage, under his own loom; and, looking up at\n",
      "the shape the loom took, and hearing the burial service distinctly read,\n",
      "he knew that he was there to suffer death.  In an instant what he stood\n",
      "on fell below him, and he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "—Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life, and to places that\n",

      "this world or the next, through all the unimaginable ages of eternity, to\n",
      "look on Rachael’s face or hear her voice.  Wandering to and fro,\n",
      "unceasingly, without hope, and in search of he knew not what (he only\n",
      "knew that he was doomed to seek it), he was the subject of a nameless,\n",
      "horrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular shape which everything\n",
      "took.  Whatsoever he looked at, grew into that form sooner or later.  The\n",

      "had closed upon it.  Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze, in the\n",
      "chair by the bed.  She sat wrapped in her shawl, perfectly still.  The\n",
      "table stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on it, in its\n",
      "real proportions and appearance, was the shape so often repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he saw the curtain move.  He looked again, and he was sure it\n",
      "moved.  He saw a hand come forth and grope about a little.  Then the\n",
      "curtain moved more perceptibly, and the woman in the bed put it back, and\n",
      "sat up.\n",
      "\n",
      "With her woful eyes, so haggard and wild, so heavy and large, she looked\n",
      "all round the room, and passed the corner where he slept in his chair.\n",
      "Her eyes returned to that corner, and she put her hand over them as a\n",
      "shade, while she looked into it.  Again they went all round the room,\n",
      "scarcely heeding Rachael if at all, and returned to that corner.  He\n",
      "thought, as she once more shaded them—not so much looking at him, as\n",
      "looking for him with a brutish instinct that he was there—that no single\n",
      "trace was left in those debauched features, or in the mind that went\n",
      "along with them, of the woman he had married eighteen years before.  But\n",
      "that he had seen her come to this by inches, he never could have believed\n",
      "her to be the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time, as if a spell were on him, he was motionless and\n",
      "powerless, except to watch her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stupidly dozing, or communing with her incapable self about nothing, she\n",
      "sat for a little while with her hands at her ears, and her head resting\n",
      "on them.  Presently, she resumed her staring round the room.  And now,\n",
      "for the first time, her eyes stopped at the table with the bottles on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner, with the defiance of\n",
      "last night, and moving very cautiously and softly, stretched out her\n",
      "greedy hand.  She drew a mug into the bed, and sat for a while\n",
      "considering which of the two bottles she should choose.  Finally, she\n",
      "laid her insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death\n",
      "in it, and, before his eyes, pulled out the cork with her teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dream or reality, he had no voice, nor had he power to stir.  If this be\n",
      "real, and her allotted time be not yet come, wake, Rachael, wake!\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought of that, too.  She looked at Rachael, and very slowly, very\n",
      "cautiously, poured out the contents.  The draught was at her lips.  A\n",
      "moment and she would be past all help, let the whole world wake and come\n",
      "about her with its utmost power.  But in that moment Rachael started up\n",
      "with a suppressed cry.  The creature struggled, struck her, seized her by\n",
      "the hair; but Rachael had the cup.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window.  They\n",
      "listened, and it struck three.  Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she\n",
      "was, noted the disorder of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her\n",
      "forehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been\n",
      "awake.  She held the cup in her hand even now.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought it must be near three,’ she said, calmly pouring from the cup\n",
      "into the basin, and steeping the linen as before.  ‘I am thankful I\n",
      "stayed!  ’Tis done now, when I have put this on.  There!  And now she’s\n",
      "quiet again.  The few drops in the basin I’ll pour away, for ’tis bad\n",
      "stuff to leave about, though ever so little of it.’  As she spoke, she\n",
      "drained the basin into the ashes of the fire, and broke the bottle on the\n",
      "hearth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with her shawl before\n",
      "going out into the wind and rain.\n",

      "TIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought\n",
      "up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.\n",
      "But, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying\n",
      "seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only\n",
      "stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Louisa is becoming,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘almost a young woman.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Time, with his innumerable horse-power, worked away, not minding what\n",
      "anybody said, and presently turned out young Thomas a foot taller than\n",
      "when his father had last taken particular notice of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thomas is becoming,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘almost a young man.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed Thomas on in the mill, while his father was thinking about\n",
      "it, and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Really,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘the period has arrived when Thomas ought\n",
      "to go to Bounderby.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Time, sticking to him, passed him on into Bounderby’s Bank, made him an\n",
      "inmate of Bounderby’s house, necessitated the purchase of his first\n",
      "razor, and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to\n",
      "number one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same great manufacturer, always with an immense variety of work on\n",
      "hand, in every stage of development, passed Sissy onward in his mill, and\n",
      "worked her up into a very pretty article indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I fear, Jupe,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘that your continuance at the school\n",
      "any longer would be useless.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am afraid it would, sir,’ Sissy answered with a curtsey.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I cannot disguise from you, Jupe,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, knitting his\n",
      "brow, ‘that the result of your probation there has disappointed me; has\n",
      "greatly disappointed me.  You have not acquired, under Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "M’Choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I\n",
      "looked for.  You are extremely deficient in your facts.  Your\n",
      "acquaintance with figures is very limited.  You are altogether backward,\n",
      "and below the mark.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sorry, sir,’ she returned; ‘but I know it is quite true.  Yet I\n",
      "have tried hard, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘yes, I believe you have tried hard; I have\n",
      "observed you, and I can find no fault in that respect.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir.  I have thought sometimes;’ Sissy very timid here; ‘that\n",
      "perhaps I tried to learn too much, and that if I had asked to be allowed\n",
      "to try a little less, I might have—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, Jupe, no,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, shaking his head in his profoundest\n",
      "and most eminently practical way.  ‘No.  The course you pursued, you\n",
      "pursued according to the system—the system—and there is no more to be\n",
      "said about it.  I can only suppose that the circumstances of your early\n",
      "life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers,\n",
      "and that we began too late.  Still, as I have said already, I am\n",
      "disappointed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment, sir, of your kindness\n",
      "to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you, and of your protection\n",
      "of her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t shed tears,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Don’t shed tears.  I don’t\n",

      "woman—and—and we must make that do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir, very much,’ said Sissy, with a grateful curtsey.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you\n",
      "are serviceable in the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa,\n",
      "and, indeed, so I have observed myself.  I therefore hope,’ said Mr.\n",
      "Gradgrind, ‘that you can make yourself happy in those relations.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should have nothing to wish, sir, if—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I understand you,’ said Mr. Gradgrind; ‘you still refer to your father.\n",
      "I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle.  Well!\n",
      "If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been\n",
      "more successful, you would have been wiser on these points.  I will say\n",
      "no more.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he\n",
      "held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must\n",
      "have fallen upon that conclusion.  Somehow or other, he had become\n",
      "possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could\n",
      "hardly be set forth in a tabular form.  Her capacity of definition might\n",
      "be easily stated at a very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at\n",
      "nothing; yet he was not sure that if he had been required, for example,\n",
      "to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return, he would have\n",
      "quite known how to divide her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of\n",
      "Time are very rapid.  Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage\n",
      "of their working up, these changes were effected in a year or two; while\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course, and underwent no\n",
      "alteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except one, which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill.\n",
      "Time hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a\n",
      "by-comer, and made him Member of Parliament for Coketown: one of the\n",
      "respected members for ounce weights and measures, one of the\n",
      "representatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable\n",
      "gentlemen, dumb honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame\n",
      "honourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other\n",

      "hundred and odd years after our Master?\n",
      "\n",
      "All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so\n",
      "much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the\n",
      "grate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said\n",
      "she was almost a young woman—which seemed but yesterday—she had scarcely\n",
      "attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Quite a young woman,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, musing.  ‘Dear me!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for\n",
      "several days, and seemed much engrossed by one subject.  On a certain\n",
      "night, when he was going out, and Louisa came to bid him good-bye before\n",
      "his departure—as he was not to be home until late and she would not see\n",
      "him again until the morning—he held her in his arms, looking at her in\n",
      "his kindest manner, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Louisa, you are a woman!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night when she\n",
      "was found at the Circus; then cast down her eyes.  ‘Yes, father.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘I must speak with you alone and\n",
      "seriously.  Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow, will you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, father.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your hands are rather cold, Louisa.  Are you not well?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Quite well, father.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And cheerful?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar manner.  ‘I am as\n",
      "cheerful, father, as I usually am, or usually have been.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s well,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  So, he kissed her and went away; and\n",
      "Louisa returned to the serene apartment of the hair-cutting character,\n",
      "and leaning her elbow on her hand, looked again at the short-lived sparks\n",
      "that so soon subsided into ashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are you there, Loo?’ said her brother, looking in at the door.  He was\n",
      "quite a young gentleman of pleasure now, and not quite a prepossessing\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dear Tom,’ she answered, rising and embracing him, ‘how long it is since\n",
      "you have been to see me!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, I have been otherwise engaged, Loo, in the evenings; and in the\n",
      "daytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at it rather.  But I touch him\n",
      "up with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an\n",
      "understanding.  I say!  Has father said anything particular to you to-day\n",
      "or yesterday, Loo?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, Tom.  But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the\n",
      "morning.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah!  That’s what I mean,’ said Tom.  ‘Do you know where he is\n",
      "to-night?’—with a very deep expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then I’ll tell you.  He’s with old Bounderby.  They are having a regular\n",
      "confab together up at the Bank.  Why at the Bank, do you think?  Well,\n",
      "I’ll tell you again.  To keep Mrs. Sparsit’s ears as far off as possible,\n",
      "I expect.’\n",
      "\n",
      "With her hand upon her brother’s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at\n",
      "the fire.  Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than\n",
      "usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are very fond of me, an’t you, Loo?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without\n",
      "coming to see me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, sister of mine,’ said Tom, ‘when you say that, you are near my\n",
      "thoughts.  We might be so much oftener together—mightn’t we?  Always\n",
      "together, almost—mightn’t we?  It would do me a great deal of good if you\n",
      "were to make up your mind to I know what, Loo.  It would be a splendid\n",
      "thing for me.  It would be uncommonly jolly!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny.  He could make nothing\n",
      "of her face.  He pressed her in his arm, and kissed her cheek.  She\n",
      "returned the kiss, but still looked at the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I say, Loo!  I thought I’d come, and just hint to you what was going on:\n",
      "though I supposed you’d most likely guess, even if you didn’t know.  I\n",
      "can’t stay, because I’m engaged to some fellows to-night.  You won’t\n",
      "forget how fond you are of me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, dear Tom, I won’t forget.’\n",

      "‘That’s a capital girl,’ said Tom.  ‘Good-bye, Loo.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave him an affectionate good-night, and went out with him to the\n",
      "door, whence the fires of Coketown could be seen, making the distance\n",
      "lurid.  She stood there, looking steadfastly towards them, and listening\n",
      "to his departing steps.  They retreated quickly, as glad to get away from\n",
      "Stone Lodge; and she stood there yet, when he was gone and all was quiet.\n",
      "It seemed as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in the\n",
      "fiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time,\n",
      "that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from\n",

      "time, ‘I would advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question,\n",
      "as you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as\n",
      "one of tangible Fact.  The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such\n",
      "subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no\n",
      "existence, properly viewed—really no existence—but it is no compliment to\n",
      "you to say, that you know better.  Now, what are the Facts of this case?\n",
      "You are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby\n",
      "is, we will say in round numbers, fifty.  There is some disparity in your\n",
      "respective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the\n",
      "contrary, there is a great suitability.  Then the question arises, Is\n",
      "this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage?  In\n",
      "considering this question, it is not unimportant to take into account the\n",
      "statistics of marriage, so far as they have yet been obtained, in England\n",
      "and Wales.  I find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion\n",
      "of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages,\n",
      "and that the elder of these contracting parties is, in rather more than\n",
      "three-fourths of these instances, the bridegroom.  It is remarkable as\n",
      "showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the\n",
      "British possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and\n",
      "among the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet\n",
      "furnished us by travellers, yield similar results.  The disparity I have\n",
      "mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all\n",
      "but disappears.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you recommend, father,’ asked Louisa, her reserved composure not\n",
      "in the least affected by these gratifying results, ‘that I should\n",
      "substitute for the term I used just now?  For the misplaced expression?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Louisa,’ returned her father, ‘it appears to me that nothing can be\n",
      "plainer.  Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you\n",
      "state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him?  Yes, he\n",
      "does.  The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him?  I think\n",
      "nothing can be plainer than that?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Shall I marry him?’ repeated Louisa, with great deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Precisely.  And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear\n",
      "Louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that\n",
      "question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that\n",
      "belong to many young women.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, father,’ she returned, ‘I do not.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I now leave you to judge for yourself,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘I have\n",
      "stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds;\n",
      "I have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its\n",
      "time.  The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.’\n",
      "\n",
      "From the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly.  As he now leaned\n",
      "back in his chair, and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn,\n",
      "perhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her, when she was\n",
      "impelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the pent-up\n",
      "confidences of her heart.  But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a\n",
      "bound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting,\n",
      "between himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will\n",
      "elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be\n",
      "sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.  The barriers were too many and\n",
      "too high for such a leap.  With his unbending, utilitarian,\n",
      "matter-of-fact face, he hardened her again; and the moment shot away into\n",
      "the plumbless depths of the past, to mingle with all the lost\n",
      "opportunities that are drowned there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Removing her eyes from him, she sat so long looking silently towards the\n",
      "town, that he said, at length: ‘Are you consulting the chimneys of the\n",
      "Coketown works, Louisa?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke.  Yet\n",
      "when the night comes, Fire bursts out, father!’ she answered, turning\n",
      "quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course I know that, Louisa.  I do not see the application of the\n",
      "remark.’  To do him justice he did not, at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "She passed it away with a slight motion of her hand, and concentrating\n",
      "her attention upon him again, said, ‘Father, I have often thought that\n",
      "life is very short.’—This was so distinctly one of his subjects that he\n",
      "interposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is short, no doubt, my dear.  Still, the average duration of human\n",
      "life is proved to have increased of late years.  The calculations of\n",
      "various life assurance and annuity offices, among other figures which\n",
      "cannot go wrong, have established the fact.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I speak of my own life, father.’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "fit for.  What does it matter?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words;\n",
      "replying, ‘How, matter?  What matter, my dear?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Bounderby,’ she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding\n",
      "this, ‘asks me to marry him.  The question I have to ask myself is, shall\n",
      "I marry him?  That is so, father, is it not?  You have told me so,\n",
      "father.  Have you not?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Certainly, my dear.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let it be so.  Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied\n",
      "to accept his proposal.  Tell him, father, as soon as you please, that\n",
      "this was my answer.  Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I\n",
      "should wish him to know what I said.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is quite right, my dear,’ retorted her father approvingly, ‘to be\n",
      "exact.  I will observe your very proper request.  Have you any wish in\n",
      "reference to the period of your marriage, my child?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘None, father.  What does it matter!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and taken her\n",
      "hand.  But, her repetition of these words seemed to strike with some\n",
      "little discord on his ear.  He paused to look at her, and, still holding\n",
      "her hand, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you one question,\n",
      "because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote.\n",
      "But perhaps I ought to do so.  You have never entertained in secret any\n",
      "other proposal?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Father,’ she returned, almost scornfully, ‘what other proposal can have\n",
      "been made to _me_?  Whom have I seen?  Where have I been?  What are my\n",
      "heart’s experiences?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Louisa,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind, reassured and satisfied.  ‘You\n",
      "correct me justly.  I merely wished to discharge my duty.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do _I_ know, father,’ said Louisa in her quiet manner, ‘of tastes\n",
      "and fancies; of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature\n",
      "in which such light things might have been nourished?  What escape have I\n",
      "had from problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be\n",
      "grasped?’  As she said it, she unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon\n",
      "a solid object, and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or\n",
      "ash.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear,’ assented her eminently practical parent, ‘quite true, quite\n",
      "true.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, father,’ she pursued, ‘what a strange question to ask _me_!  The\n",
      "baby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children, has\n",
      "never had its innocent resting-place in my breast.  You have been so\n",
      "careful of me, that I never had a child’s heart.  You have trained me so\n",
      "well, that I never dreamed a child’s dream.  You have dealt so wisely\n",
      "with me, father, from my cradle to this hour, that I never had a child’s\n",
      "belief or a child’s fear.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and by this testimony to\n",
      "it.  ‘My dear Louisa,’ said he, ‘you abundantly repay my care.  Kiss me,\n",
      "my dear girl.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So, his daughter kissed him.  Detaining her in his embrace, he said, ‘I\n",
      "may assure you now, my favourite child, that I am made happy by the sound\n",
      "decision at which you have arrived.  Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable\n",
      "man; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you—if any—is\n",
      "more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired.  It has\n",
      "always been my object so to educate you, as that you might, while still\n",
      "in your early youth, be (if I may so express myself) almost any age.\n",
      "Kiss me once more, Louisa.  Now, let us go and find your mother.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady\n",
      "with no nonsense about her, was recumbent as usual, while Sissy worked\n",
      "beside her.  She gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they\n",
      "entered, and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting\n",
      "attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said her husband, who had waited for the achievement of\n",
      "this feat with some impatience, ‘allow me to present to you Mrs.\n",
      "Bounderby.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh!’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, ‘so you have settled it!  Well, I’m sure I\n",
      "hope your health may be good, Louisa; for if your head begins to split as\n",
      "soon as you are married, which was the case with mine, I cannot consider\n",
      "that you are to be envied, though I have no doubt you think you are, as\n",
      "all girls do.  However, I give you joy, my dear—and I hope you may now\n",
      "turn all your ological studies to good account, I am sure I do!  I must\n",
      "give you a kiss of congratulation, Louisa; but don’t touch my right\n",
      "shoulder, for there’s something running down it all day long.  And now\n",
      "you see,’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the\n",
      "affectionate ceremony, ‘I shall be worrying myself, morning, noon, and\n",
      "night, to know what I am to call him!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Gradgrind,’ said her husband, solemnly, ‘what do you mean?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Whatever I am to call him, Mr. Gradgrind, when he is married to Louisa!\n",
      "I must call him something.  It’s impossible,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a\n",
      "mingled sense of politeness and injury, ‘to be constantly addressing him\n",
      "and never giving him a name.  I cannot call him Josiah, for the name is\n",
      "insupportable to me.  You yourself wouldn’t hear of Joe, you very well\n",
      "know.  Am I to call my own son-in-law, Mister!  Not, I believe, unless\n",
      "the time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled upon by my\n",
      "relations.  Then, what am I to call him!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable\n",
      "emergency, Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being, after\n",
      "delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is,—and I ask it with a fluttering\n",
      "in my chest, which actually extends to the soles of my feet,—that it may\n",
      "take place soon.  Otherwise, I know it is one of those subjects I shall\n",
      "never hear the last of.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby, Sissy had suddenly\n",
      "turned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in\n",
      "a multitude of emotions, towards Louisa.  Louisa had known it, and seen\n",
      "it, without looking at her.  From that moment she was impassive, proud\n",
      "and cold—held Sissy at a distance—changed to her altogether.\n",

      "\n",
      "MR. BOUNDERBY’S first disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was\n",
      "occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit.  He could\n",
      "not make up his mind how to do that, or what the consequences of the step\n",
      "might be.  Whether she would instantly depart, bag and baggage, to Lady\n",
      "Scadgers, or would positively refuse to budge from the premises; whether\n",
      "she would be plaintive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she would\n",
      "break her heart, or break the looking-glass; Mr. Bounderby could not all\n",
      "foresee.  However, as it must be done, he had no choice but to do it; so,\n",
      "after attempting several letters, and failing in them all, he resolved to\n",
      "do it by word of mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his way home, on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose,\n",
      "he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist’s shop and buying a\n",
      "bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts.  ‘By George!’ said Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby, ‘if she takes it in the fainting way, I’ll have the skin off\n",
      "her nose, at all events!’  But, in spite of being thus forearmed, he\n",
      "entered his own house with anything but a courageous air; and appeared\n",
      "before the object of his misgivings, like a dog who was conscious of\n",
      "coming direct from the pantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good evening, Mr. Bounderby!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good evening, ma’am, good evening.’  He drew up his chair, and Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit drew back hers, as who should say, ‘Your fireside, sir.  I freely\n",
      "admit it.  It is for you to occupy it all, if you think proper.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t go to the North Pole, ma’am!’ said Mr. Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned, though short of her\n",
      "former position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points of a stiff, sharp\n",
      "pair of scissors, she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental\n",
      "purpose, in a piece of cambric.  An operation which, taken in connexion\n",
      "with the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose, suggested with some\n",
      "liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little\n",
      "bird.  She was so steadfastly occupied, that many minutes elapsed before\n",
      "she looked up from her work; when she did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her\n",
      "attention with a hitch of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his\n",
      "pockets, and assuring himself with his right hand that the cork of the\n",
      "little bottle was ready for use, ‘I have no occasion to say to you, that\n",
      "you are not only a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible woman.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ returned the lady, ‘this is indeed not the first time that you\n",
      "have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘I am going to astonish you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir?’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, interrogatively, and in the most\n",
      "tranquil manner possible.  She generally wore mittens, and she now laid\n",
      "down her work, and smoothed those mittens.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am going, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘to marry Tom Gradgrind’s daughter.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘I hope you may be happy, Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby.  Oh, indeed I hope you may be happy, sir!’  And she said it\n",
      "with such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for\n",
      "him, that Bounderby,—far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her\n",
      "workbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug,—corked up the\n",
      "smelling-salts tight in his pocket, and thought, ‘Now confound this\n",
      "woman, who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish with all my heart, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, in a highly superior\n",
      "manner; somehow she seemed, in a moment, to have established a right to\n",
      "pity him ever afterwards; ‘that you may be in all respects very happy.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am,’ returned Bounderby, with some resentment in his tone:\n",
      "which was clearly lowered, though in spite of himself, ‘I am obliged to\n",
      "you.  I hope I shall be.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Do_ you, sir!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability.  ‘But\n",
      "naturally you do; of course you do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby’s part, succeeded.  Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "sedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough, which\n",
      "sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am,’ resumed Bounderby, ‘under these circumstances, I imagine\n",
      "it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here,\n",
      "though you would be very welcome here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!’ Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "shook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed\n",
      "the small cough—coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within\n",
      "her, but had better be coughed down.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘However, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘there are apartments at the Bank,\n",
      "where a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a\n",
      "catch than otherwise; and if the same terms—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I beg your pardon, sir.  You were so good as to promise that you would\n",
      "always substitute the phrase, annual compliment.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am, annual compliment.  If the same annual compliment would be\n",
      "acceptable there, why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘The proposal is like yourself, and if the\n",
      "position I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without\n",
      "descending lower in the social scale—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, of course it is,’ said Bounderby.  ‘If it was not, ma’am, you don’t\n",
      "suppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you\n",
      "have moved in.  Not that _I_ care for such society, you know!  But _you_\n",
      "do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’ll have your own private apartments, and you’ll have your coals and\n",
      "your candles, and all the rest of it, and you’ll have your maid to attend\n",
      "upon you, and you’ll have your light porter to protect you, and you’ll be\n",
      "what I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable,’ said\n",
      "Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, ‘say no more.  In yielding up my trust\n",
      "here, I shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of\n",
      "dependence:’ she might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate\n",
      "article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: ‘and I would\n",
      "rather receive it from your hand, than from any other.  Therefore, sir, I\n",
      "accept your offer gratefully, and with many sincere acknowledgments for\n",
      "past favours.  And I hope, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, concluding in an\n",
      "impressively compassionate manner, ‘I fondly hope that Miss Gradgrind may\n",
      "be all you desire, and deserve!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more.  It was in vain\n",
      "for Bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive\n",
      "ways; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him, as a Victim.\n",
      "She was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the\n",
      "more obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary\n",
      "altogether, she; the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim, he.  She had that\n",
      "tenderness for his melancholy fate, that his great red countenance used\n",
      "to break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks’\n",
      "time, and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted\n",
      "wooer.  Love was made on these occasions in the form of bracelets; and,\n",
      "on all occasions during the period of betrothal, took a manufacturing\n",
      "aspect.  Dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were\n",

      "\n",
      "There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who\n",
      "knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it\n",
      "was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms,\n",
      "whether native or foreign, and all about it.  The bridesmaids, down to\n",
      "little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit\n",
      "helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of\n",
      "the company.\n",

      "After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Since you have\n",
      "done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness,\n",
      "I suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and\n",
      "know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won’t expect a speech\n",
      "from a man who, when he sees a Post, says “that’s a Post,” and when he\n",
      "sees a Pump, says “that’s a Pump,” and is not to be got to call a Post a\n",
      "Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick.  If you want a\n",
      "speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a\n",
      "Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it.  I am not your man.\n",
      "However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table\n",
      "to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind’s\n",
      "daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless\n",
      "it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I\n",
      "may be excused.  So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you\n",
      "don’t, I can’t help it.  I _do_ feel independent.  Now I have mentioned,\n",
      "and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind’s\n",
      "daughter.  I am very glad to be so.  It has long been my wish to be so.\n",
      "I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me.  At\n",
      "the same time—not to deceive you—I believe I am worthy of her.  So, I\n",
      "thank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards\n",
      "us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present\n",
      "company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have\n",

      "A SUNNY midsummer day.  There was such a thing sometimes, even in\n",
      "Coketown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of\n",
      "its own, which appeared impervious to the sun’s rays.  You only knew the\n",
      "town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky\n",
      "blotch upon the prospect without a town.  A blur of soot and smoke, now\n",
      "confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of\n",
      "Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell,\n",
      "or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross\n",
      "light in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:—Coketown in the\n",
      "distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be\n",
      "seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wonder was, it was there at all.  It had been ruined so often, that\n",
      "it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks.  Surely there never was\n",
      "such fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were\n",
      "made.  Handle them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with such\n",
      "ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before.  They were\n",
      "ruined, when they were required to send labouring children to school;\n",
      "they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works;\n",
      "they were ruined, when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether\n",
      "they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery;\n",
      "they were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not\n",
      "always make quite so much smoke.  Besides Mr. Bounderby’s gold spoon\n",
      "which was generally received in Coketown, another prevalent fiction was\n",
      "very popular there.  It took the form of a threat.  Whenever a Coketowner\n",
      "felt he was ill-used—that is to say, whenever he was not left entirely\n",
      "alone, and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences\n",
      "of any of his acts—he was sure to come out with the awful menace, that he\n",
      "would ‘sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic.’  This had terrified\n",
      "the Home Secretary within an inch of his life, on several occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had\n",
      "pitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had\n",
      "been kind enough to take mighty good care of it.  So there it was, in the\n",
      "haze yonder; and it increased and multiplied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so\n",
      "bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over\n",
      "Coketown, and could not be looked at steadily.  Stokers emerged from low\n",
      "underground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and\n",
      "palings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals.  The\n",
      "whole town seemed to be frying in oil.  There was a stifling smell of hot\n",
      "oil everywhere.  The steam-engines shone with it, the dresses of the\n",
      "Hands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories oozed\n",
      "and trickled it.  The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the\n",
      "breath of the simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled\n",
      "languidly in the desert.  But no temperature made the melancholy mad\n",
      "elephants more mad or more sane.  Their wearisome heads went up and down\n",
      "at the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet weather and dry, fair\n",
      "weather and foul.  The measured motion of their shadows on the walls, was\n",
      "the substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods;\n",
      "while, for the summer hum of insects, it could offer, all the year round,\n",
      "from the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the whirr of shafts and\n",
      "wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny day, making the passenger\n",
      "more sleepy and more hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills.\n",
      "Sun-blinds, and sprinklings of water, a little cooled the main streets\n",
      "and the shops; but the mills, and the courts and alleys, baked at a\n",
      "fierce heat.  Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some\n",
      "Coketown boys who were at large—a rare sight there—rowed a crazy boat,\n",
      "which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every\n",
      "dip of an oar stirred up vile smells.  But the sun itself, however\n",
      "beneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and\n",
      "rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering\n",
      "more death than life.  So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil\n",
      "eye, when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the\n",
      "things it looks upon to bless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank, on the shadier\n",
      "side of the frying street.  Office-hours were over: and at that period of\n",
      "the day, in warm weather, she usually embellished with her genteel\n",
      "presence, a managerial board-room over the public office.  Her own\n",
      "private sitting-room was a story higher, at the window of which post of\n",
      "observation she was ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he\n",
      "came across the road, with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a\n",
      "Victim.  He had been married now a year; and Mrs. Sparsit had never\n",
      "released him from her determined pity a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town.  It\n",
      "was another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside\n",
      "blinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and\n",
      "a brazen door-handle full stop.  It was a size larger than Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby’s house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes\n",
      "smaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide among the\n",
      "desks and writing implements, she shed a feminine, not to say also\n",
      "aristocratic, grace upon the office.  Seated, with her needlework or\n",
      "netting apparatus, at the window, she had a self-laudatory sense of\n",
      "correcting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the\n",
      "place.  With this impression of her interesting character upon her, Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit considered herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy.  The\n",
      "townspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her there, regarded\n",
      "her as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "What those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did.  Gold\n",
      "and silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring\n",
      "vague destruction upon vague persons (generally, however, people whom she\n",
      "disliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof.  For the\n",
      "rest, she knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the\n",
      "office furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks,\n",
      "against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head\n",
      "every night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared at cockcrow.  Further,\n",
      "she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply\n",
      "spiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the\n",
      "relics of the current day’s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out\n",
      "pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that\n",
      "nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "tried.  Lastly, she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and\n",
      "carbines, arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official\n",
      "chimney-pieces; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated\n",
      "from a place of business claiming to be wealthy—a row of\n",
      "fire-buckets—vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any\n",
      "occasion, but observed to exercise a fine moral influence, almost equal\n",
      "to bullion, on most beholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit’s\n",
      "empire.  The deaf serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying\n",
      "had for years gone about among the lower orders of Coketown, that she\n",
      "would be murdered some night when the Bank was shut, for the sake of her\n",
      "money.  It was generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some\n",
      "time, and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and\n",
      "her situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much\n",
      "offence and disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit’s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its\n",
      "tripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours,\n",
      "into the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that\n",
      "bestrode the middle of the room.  The light porter placed the tea-tray on\n",
      "it, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank _you_, ma’am,’ returned the light porter.  He was a very light\n",
      "porter indeed; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a\n",
      "horse, for girl number twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All is shut up, Bitzer?’ said Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All is shut up, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her tea, ‘is the news of the\n",
      "day?  Anything?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am, I can’t say that I have heard anything particular.  Our\n",
      "people are a bad lot, ma’am; but that is no news, unfortunately.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What are the restless wretches doing now?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Merely going on in the old way, ma’am.  Uniting, and leaguing, and\n",
      "engaging to stand by one another.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is much to be regretted,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more\n",
      "Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity,\n",
      "‘that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, ma’am,’ said Bitzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces\n",
      "against employing any man who is united with any other man,’ said Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They have done that, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer; ‘but it rather fell\n",
      "through, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not pretend to understand these things,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with\n",
      "dignity, ‘my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere;\n",
      "and Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any\n",
      "such dissensions.  I only know that these people must be conquered, and\n",
      "that it’s high time it was done, once for all.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit’s oracular authority.  ‘You couldn’t put it clearer, I am\n",
      "sure, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was\n",
      "going to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers,\n",
      "inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing\n",
      "through the open window, down into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not a very busy day, my lady.  About an average day.’  He now and then\n",
      "slided into my lady, instead of ma’am, as an involuntary acknowledgment\n",
      "of Mrs. Sparsit’s personal dignity and claims to reverence.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The clerks,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible\n",
      "crumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, ‘are trustworthy,\n",
      "punctual, and industrious, of course?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, ma’am, pretty fair, ma’am.  With the usual exception.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the\n",
      "establishment, for which volunteer service he received a present at\n",
      "Christmas, over and above his weekly wage.  He had grown into an\n",
      "extremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young man, who was safe to rise\n",
      "in the world.  His mind was so exactly regulated, that he had no\n",
      "affections or passions.  All his proceedings were the result of the\n",
      "nicest and coldest calculation; and it was not without cause that Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit habitually observed of him, that he was a young man of the\n",
      "steadiest principle she had ever known.  Having satisfied himself, on his\n",
      "father’s death, that his mother had a right of settlement in Coketown,\n",
      "this excellent young economist had asserted that right for her with such\n",
      "a steadfast adherence to the principle of the case, that she had been\n",
      "shut up in the workhouse ever since.  It must be admitted that he allowed\n",
      "her half a pound of tea a year, which was weak in him: first, because all\n",
      "gifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the recipient, and\n",
      "secondly, because his only reasonable transaction in that commodity would\n",
      "have been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give, and sell it\n",
      "for as much as he could possibly get; it having been clearly ascertained\n",
      "by philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of man—not a\n",
      "part of man’s duty, but the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pretty fair, ma’am.  With the usual exception, ma’am,’ repeated Bitzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah—h!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head over her tea-cup, and taking\n",
      "a long gulp.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Thomas, ma’am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much, ma’am, I don’t like his\n",
      "ways at all.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive manner, ‘do you\n",
      "recollect my having said anything to you respecting names?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I beg your pardon, ma’am.  It’s quite true that you did object to names\n",
      "being used, and they’re always best avoided.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please to remember that I have a charge here,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with\n",
      "her air of state.  ‘I hold a trust here, Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby.\n",
      "However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it\n",
      "years ago, that he would ever become my patron, making me an annual\n",
      "compliment, I cannot but regard him in that light.  From Mr. Bounderby I\n",
      "have received every acknowledgment of my social station, and every\n",
      "recognition of my family descent, that I could possibly expect.  More,\n",
      "far more.  Therefore, to my patron I will be scrupulously true.  And I do\n",
      "not consider, I will not consider, I cannot consider,’ said Mrs. Sparsit,\n",
      "with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, ‘that I\n",
      "_should_ be scrupulously true, if I allowed names to be mentioned under\n",
      "this roof, that are unfortunately—most unfortunately—no doubt of\n",
      "that—connected with his.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, Bitzer,’ continued Mrs. Sparsit, ‘say an individual, and I will hear\n",
      "you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘With the usual exception, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, trying back, ‘of an\n",
      "individual.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah—h!’  Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head\n",
      "over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again\n",
      "at the point where it had been interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘An individual, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, ‘has never been what he ought to\n",
      "have been, since he first came into the place.  He is a dissipated,\n",
      "extravagant idler.  He is not worth his salt, ma’am.  He wouldn’t get it\n",
      "either, if he hadn’t a friend and relation at court, ma’am!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah—h!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I only hope, ma’am,’ pursued Bitzer, ‘that his friend and relation may\n",
      "not supply him with the means of carrying on.  Otherwise, ma’am, we know\n",
      "out of whose pocket _that_ money comes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah—h!’ sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He is to be pitied, ma’am.  The last party I have alluded to, is to be\n",
      "pitied, ma’am,’ said Bitzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘I have always pitied the delusion,\n",
      "always.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As to an individual, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing\n",
      "nearer, ‘he is as improvident as any of the people in this town.  And you\n",
      "know what _their_ improvidence is, ma’am.  No one could wish to know it\n",
      "better than a lady of your eminence does.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They would do well,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘to take example by you,\n",
      "Bitzer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, ma’am.  But, since you do refer to me, now look at me, ma’am.\n",
      "I have put by a little, ma’am, already.  That gratuity which I receive at\n",
      "Christmas, ma’am: I never touch it.  I don’t even go the length of my\n",
      "wages, though they’re not high, ma’am.  Why can’t they do as I have done,\n",
      "ma’am?  What one person can do, another can do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "This, again, was among the fictions of Coketown.  Any capitalist there,\n",
      "who had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, always professed to\n",
      "wonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands didn’t each make sixty\n",
      "thousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less reproached them every\n",
      "one for not accomplishing the little feat.  What I did you can do.  Why\n",
      "don’t you go and do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As to their wanting recreations, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, ‘it’s stuff and\n",
      "nonsense.  _I_ don’t want recreations.  I never did, and I never shall; I\n",
      "don’t like ’em.  As to their combining together; there are many of them,\n",
      "I have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon one another could\n",
      "earn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve\n",
      "their livelihood.  Then, why don’t they improve it, ma’am!  It’s the\n",
      "first consideration of a rational creature, and it’s what they pretend to\n",
      "want.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pretend indeed!’ said Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma’am, till it becomes quite\n",
      "nauseous, concerning their wives and families,’ said Bitzer.  ‘Why look\n",
      "at me, ma’am!  I don’t want a wife and family.  Why should they?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Because they are improvident,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer, ‘that’s where it is.  If they were more\n",
      "provident and less perverse, ma’am, what would they do?  They would say,\n",
      "“While my hat covers my family,” or “while my bonnet covers my\n",
      "family,”—as the case might be, ma’am—“I have only one to feed, and that’s\n",
      "the person I most like to feed.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To be sure,’ assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return\n",
      "for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit’s improving conversation.  ‘Would you wish\n",
      "a little more hot water, ma’am, or is there anything else that I could\n",
      "fetch you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing just now, Bitzer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, ma’am.  I shouldn’t wish to disturb you at your meals, ma’am,\n",
      "particularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,’ said Bitzer, craning a\n",
      "little to look over into the street from where he stood; ‘but there’s a\n",
      "gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma’am, and he has come\n",
      "across as if he was going to knock.  That _is_ his knock, ma’am, no\n",
      "doubt.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again,\n",
      "confirmed himself with, ‘Yes, ma’am.  Would you wish the gentleman to be\n",
      "shown in, ma’am?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know who it can be,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her mouth and\n",
      "arranging her mittens.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A stranger, ma’am, evidently.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless\n",
      "he comes upon some business for which he is too late, I don’t know,’ said\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit, ‘but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it.  If to see him is any part of\n",
      "the duty I have accepted, I will see him.  Use your own discretion,\n",
      "Bitzer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit’s magnanimous words,\n",
      "repeated his knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open\n",
      "the door; while Mrs. Sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little\n",
      "table, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and then decamped\n",
      "up-stairs, that she might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you please, ma’am, the gentleman would wish to see you,’ said Bitzer,\n",
      "with his light eye at Mrs. Sparsit’s keyhole.  So, Mrs. Sparsit, who had\n",
      "improved the interval by touching up her cap, took her classical features\n",
      "down-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the manner of a Roman\n",
      "matron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitor having strolled to the window, and being then engaged in\n",
      "looking carelessly out, was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man\n",
      "could possibly be.  He stood whistling to himself with all imaginable\n",
      "coolness, with his hat still on, and a certain air of exhaustion upon\n",
      "him, in part arising from excessive summer, and in part from excessive\n",
      "gentility.  For it was to be seen with half an eye that he was a thorough\n",
      "gentleman, made to the model of the time; weary of everything, and\n",
      "putting no more faith in anything than Lucifer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I believe, sir,’ quoth Mrs. Sparsit, ‘you wished to see me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I beg your pardon,’ he said, turning and removing his hat; ‘pray excuse\n",
      "me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Humph!’ thought Mrs. Sparsit, as she made a stately bend.  ‘Five and\n",
      "thirty, good-looking, good figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding,\n",
      "well-dressed, dark hair, bold eyes.’  All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in\n",
      "her womanly way—like the Sultan who put his head in the pail of\n",
      "water—merely in dipping down and coming up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please to be seated, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you.  Allow me.’  He placed a chair for her, but remained himself\n",
      "carelessly lounging against the table.  ‘I left my servant at the railway\n",
      "looking after the luggage—very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the\n",
      "van—and strolled on, looking about me.  Exceedingly odd place.  Will you\n",
      "allow me to ask you if it’s _always_ as black as this?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In general much blacker,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, in her uncompromising\n",
      "way.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is it possible!  Excuse me: you are not a native, I think?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘It was once my good or ill fortune,\n",
      "as it may be—before I became a widow—to move in a very different sphere.\n",
      "My husband was a Powler.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Beg your pardon, really!’ said the stranger.  ‘Was—?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit repeated, ‘A Powler.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Powler Family,’ said the stranger, after reflecting a few moments.  Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit signified assent.  The stranger seemed a little more fatigued\n",
      "than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You must be very much bored here?’ was the inference he drew from the\n",
      "communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am the servant of circumstances, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘and I have\n",
      "long adapted myself to the governing power of my life.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very philosophical,’ returned the stranger, ‘and very exemplary and\n",
      "laudable, and—’  It seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the\n",
      "sentence, so he played with his watch-chain wearily.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘May I be permitted to ask, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘to what I am\n",
      "indebted for the favour of—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Assuredly,’ said the stranger.  ‘Much obliged to you for reminding me.\n",
      "I am the bearer of a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby, the banker.\n",
      "Walking through this extraordinarily black town, while they were getting\n",
      "dinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom I met; one of the\n",
      "working people; who appeared to have been taking a shower-bath of\n",
      "something fluffy, which I assume to be the raw material—’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit inclined her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘—Raw material—where Mr. Bounderby, the banker, might reside.  Upon\n",
      "which, misled no doubt by the word Banker, he directed me to the Bank.\n",
      "Fact being, I presume, that Mr. Bounderby the Banker does _not_ reside in\n",
      "the edifice in which I have the honour of offering this explanation?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘he does not.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you.  I had no intention of delivering my letter at the present\n",
      "moment, nor have I. But strolling on to the Bank to kill time, and having\n",
      "the good fortune to observe at the window,’ towards which he languidly\n",
      "waved his hand, then slightly bowed, ‘a lady of a very superior and\n",
      "agreeable appearance, I considered that I could not do better than take\n",
      "the liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker _does_\n",
      "live.  Which I accordingly venture, with all suitable apologies, to do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently relieved,\n",
      "to Mrs. Sparsit’s thinking, by a certain gallantry at ease, which offered\n",
      "her homage too.  Here he was, for instance, at this moment, all but\n",
      "sitting on the table, and yet lazily bending over her, as if he\n",
      "acknowledged an attraction in her that made her charming—in her way.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Banks, I know, are always suspicious, and officially must be,’ said the\n",
      "stranger, whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant\n",
      "likewise; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever\n",
      "contained—which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this\n",
      "numerous sect, whosoever may have been that great man: ‘therefore I may\n",
      "observe that my letter—here it is—is from the member for this\n",
      "place—Gradgrind—whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in London.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such confirmation was\n",
      "quite unnecessary, and gave Mr. Bounderby’s address, with all needful\n",
      "clues and directions in aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thousand thanks,’ said the stranger.  ‘Of course you know the Banker\n",
      "well?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘In my dependent relation towards\n",
      "him, I have known him ten years.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Quite an eternity!  I think he married Gradgrind’s daughter?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her mouth, ‘he had\n",
      "that—honour.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Indeed, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘_Is_ she?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Excuse my impertinent curiosity,’ pursued the stranger, fluttering over\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit’s eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, ‘but you know the\n",
      "family, and know the world.  I am about to know the family, and may have\n",
      "much to do with them.  Is the lady so very alarming?  Her father gives\n",
      "her such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that I have a burning\n",
      "desire to know.  Is she absolutely unapproachable?  Repellently and\n",
      "stunningly clever?  I see, by your meaning smile, you think not.  You\n",
      "have poured balm into my anxious soul.  As to age, now.  Forty?  Five and\n",
      "thirty?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright.  ‘A chit,’ said she.  ‘Not twenty when she\n",
      "was married.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,’ returned the stranger, detaching\n",
      "himself from the table, ‘that I never was so astonished in my life!’\n",
      "\n",
      "It really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent of his capacity\n",
      "of being impressed.  He looked at his informant for full a quarter of a\n",
      "minute, and appeared to have the surprise in his mind all the time.  ‘I\n",
      "assure you, Mrs. Powler,’ he then said, much exhausted, ‘that the\n",
      "father’s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity.  I am obliged\n",
      "to you, of all things, for correcting so absurd a mistake.  Pray excuse\n",
      "my intrusion.  Many thanks.  Good day!’\n",
      "\n",
      "He bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw\n",
      "him languishing down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of\n",
      "all the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you think of the gentleman, Bitzer?’ she asked the light porter,\n",
      "when he came to take away.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Spends a deal of money on his dress, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It must be admitted,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘that it’s very tasteful.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, ma’am,’ returned Bitzer, ‘if that’s worth the money.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Besides which, ma’am,’ resumed Bitzer, while he was polishing the table,\n",
      "‘he looks to me as if he gamed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s immoral to game,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s ridiculous, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, ‘because the chances are against\n",
      "the players.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working, or\n",
      "whether it was that her hand was out, she did no work that night.  She\n",
      "sat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat\n",
      "there, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it,\n",
      "when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward,\n",
      "upward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of\n",
      "the factory chimneys, up to the sky.  Without a candle in the room, Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not thinking much\n",
      "of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the\n",
      "rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street\n",
      "cries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by,\n",
      "the shutting-up of shop-shutters.  Not until the light porter announced\n",
      "that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself\n",
      "from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows—by that time\n",
      "creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O, you Fool!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone at her supper.  Whom\n",
      "she meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the\n",
      "Graces.  They went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits\n",
      "more hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out\n",
      "everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were\n",
      "attractive to many of the Gradgrind school.  They liked fine gentlemen;\n",
      "they pretended that they did not, but they did.  They became exhausted in\n",
      "imitation of them; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they\n",
      "served out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political\n",
      "economy, on which they regaled their disciples.  There never before was\n",
      "seen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school,\n",
      "there was one of a good family and a better appearance, with a happy turn\n",
      "of humour which had told immensely with the House of Commons on the\n",
      "occasion of his entertaining it with his (and the Board of Directors)\n",
      "view of a railway accident, in which the most careful officers ever\n",
      "known, employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by\n",
      "the finest mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole in action on\n",
      "the best line ever constructed, had killed five people and wounded\n",
      "thirty-two, by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole\n",
      "system would have been positively incomplete.  Among the slain was a cow,\n",
      "and among the scattered articles unowned, a widow’s cap.  And the\n",
      "honourable member had so tickled the House (which has a delicate sense of\n",
      "humour) by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any\n",
      "serious reference to the Coroner’s Inquest, and brought the railway off\n",
      "with Cheers and Laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than\n",
      "himself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore;\n",
      "and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad,\n",
      "and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored\n",
      "there; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored\n",
      "everywhere.  To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said\n",
      "one day, ‘Jem, there’s a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and\n",
      "they want men.  I wonder you don’t go in for statistics.’  Jem, rather\n",
      "taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as\n",
      "ready to ‘go in’ for statistics as for anything else.  So, he went in.\n",
      "He coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it\n",
      "about among the hard Fact fellows, and said, ‘If you want to bring in,\n",
      "for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,\n",
      "look after my brother Jem, for he’s your man.’  After a few dashes in the\n",
      "public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages\n",
      "approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to\n",
      "become known there and in the neighbourhood.  Hence the letter Jem had\n",
      "last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his\n",
      "hand; superscribed, ‘Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown.\n",

      "\n",
      "Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse’s\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Coketown, sir,’ said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, ‘is not the\n",
      "kind of place you have been accustomed to.  Therefore, if you will allow\n",
      "me—or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man—I’ll tell you\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Don’t be too sure of that,’ said Bounderby.  ‘I don’t promise it.  First\n",

      "healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the\n",
      "lungs.  If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from\n",
      "you.  We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster\n",
      "than we wear ’em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great\n",

      "talk about the work in our mills, no doubt.  You have?  Very good.  I’ll\n",
      "state the fact of it to you.  It’s the pleasantest work there is, and\n",
      "it’s the lightest work there is, and it’s the best-paid work there is.\n",
      "More than that, we couldn’t improve the mills themselves, unless we laid\n",
      "down Turkey carpets on the floors.  Which we’re not a-going to do.’\n",

      "‘Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.’\n",

      "That object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.\n",
      "Now, they’re not a-going—none of ’em—ever to be fed on turtle soup and\n",
      "venison with a gold spoon.  And now you know the place.’\n",

      "Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and\n",
      "refreshed, by this condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, you see,’ replied Mr. Bounderby, ‘it suits my disposition to have a\n",
      "full understanding with a man, particularly with a public man, when I\n",
      "make his acquaintance.  I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr.\n",
      "Harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall\n",
      "respond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom Gradgrind’s\n",
      "letter of introduction.  You are a man of family.  Don’t you deceive\n",
      "yourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family.  I am a bit\n",
      "of dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag, and bobtail.’\n",

      "If anything could have exalted Jem’s interest in Mr. Bounderby, it would\n",
      "have been this very circumstance.  Or, so he told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So now,’ said Bounderby, ‘we may shake hands on equal terms.  I say,\n",
      "equal terms, because although I know what I am, and the exact depth of\n",
      "the gutter I have lifted myself out of, better than any man does, I am as\n",
      "proud as you are.  I am just as proud as you are.  Having now asserted my\n",
      "independence in a proper manner, I may come to how do you find yourself,\n",
      "and I hope you’re pretty well.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The better, Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as they shook hands, for\n",
      "the salubrious air of Coketown.  Mr. Bounderby received the answer with\n",
      "favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps you know,’ said he, ‘or perhaps you don’t know, I married Tom\n",

      "They went out without further discourse; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the\n",
      "new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him, to the private red\n",
      "brick dwelling, with the black outside shutters, the green inside blinds,\n",
      "and the black street door up the two white steps.  In the drawing-room of\n",
      "which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl\n",
      "Mr. James Harthouse had ever seen.  She was so constrained, and yet so\n",
      "careless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so\n",
      "sensitively ashamed of her husband’s braggart humility—from which she\n",
      "shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that it was quite\n",
      "a new sensation to observe her.  In face she was no less remarkable than\n",
      "in manner.  Her features were handsome; but their natural play was so\n",
      "locked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine\n",
      "expression.  Utterly indifferent, perfectly self-reliant, never at a\n",
      "loss, and yet never at her ease, with her figure in company with them\n",
      "there, and her mind apparently quite alone—it was of no use ‘going in’\n",
      "yet awhile to comprehend this girl, for she baffled all penetration.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the mistress of the house, the visitor glanced to the house itself.\n",
      "There was no mute sign of a woman in the room.  No graceful little\n",
      "adornment, no fanciful little device, however trivial, anywhere expressed\n",
      "her influence.  Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich,\n",
      "there the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved\n",
      "by the least trace of any womanly occupation.  As Mr. Bounderby stood in\n",
      "the midst of his household gods, so those unrelenting divinities occupied\n",
      "their places around Mr. Bounderby, and they were worthy of one another,\n",
      "and well matched.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This, sir,’ said Bounderby, ‘is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind’s\n",

      "your father’s muster-roll.  If he is not Tom Gradgrind’s colleague before\n",
      "long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of\n",
      "our neighbouring towns.  You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my\n",
      "junior.  I don’t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw\n",
      "something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn’t have married me.  She has\n",
      "lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise.  If you want\n",
      "to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better\n",
      "adviser than Loo Bounderby.’\n",
      "\n",
      "To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to\n",
      "learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come!’ said his host.  ‘If you’re in the complimentary line, you’ll get\n",
      "on here, for you’ll meet with no competition.  I have never been in the\n",
      "way of learning compliments myself, and I don’t profess to understand the\n",
      "art of paying ’em.  In fact, despise ’em.  But, your bringing-up was\n",
      "different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George!  You’re a\n",
      "gentleman, and I don’t pretend to be one.  I am Josiah Bounderby of\n",
      "Coketown, and that’s enough for me.  However, though I am not influenced\n",
      "by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be.  She hadn’t my\n",
      "advantages—disadvantages you would call ’em, but I call ’em advantages—so\n",

      "natural that you should.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby\n",
      "has said, to the service of your country.  You have made up your mind,’\n",
      "said Louisa, still standing before him where she had first stopped—in all\n",
      "the singular contrariety of her self-possession, and her being obviously\n",
      "very ill at ease—‘to show the nation the way out of all its\n",
      "difficulties.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ he returned, laughing, ‘upon my honour, no.  I will\n",
      "make no such pretence to you.  I have seen a little, here and there, up\n",
      "and down; I have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and\n",
      "as some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in for your\n",
      "respected father’s opinions—really because I have no choice of opinions,\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I have not so much as the slightest predilection left.  I assure you I\n",
      "attach not the least importance to any opinions.  The result of the\n",
      "varieties of boredom I have undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction\n",
      "is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the\n",
      "subject), that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other\n",
      "set, and just as much harm as any other set.  There’s an English family\n",
      "with a charming Italian motto.  What will be, will be.  It’s the only\n",
      "truth going!’\n",
      "\n",
      "This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty—a vice so dangerous, so\n",
      "deadly, and so common—seemed, he observed, a little to impress her in his\n",
      "favour.  He followed up the advantage, by saying in his pleasantest\n",
      "manner: a manner to which she might attach as much or as little meaning\n",
      "as she pleased: ‘The side that can prove anything in a line of units,\n",
      "tens, hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the\n",
      "most fun, and to give a man the best chance.  I am quite as much attached\n",
      "to it as if I believed it.  I am quite ready to go in for it, to the same\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You are a singular politician,’ said Louisa.\n",
      "\n",

      "Mr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed\n",
      "here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six,\n",
      "and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to\n",
      "the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity.\n",
      "The round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet\n",
      "use of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a\n",
      "considerable accession of boredom.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, he found the dinner-table laid for four, but they sat\n",
      "down only three.  It was an appropriate occasion for Mr. Bounderby to\n",
      "discuss the flavour of the hap’orth of stewed eels he had purchased in\n",
      "the streets at eight years old; and also of the inferior water, specially\n",
      "used for laying the dust, with which he had washed down that repast.  He\n",
      "likewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the\n",
      "calculation that he (Bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least three\n",
      "horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.  These recitals, Jem, in\n",
      "a languid manner, received with ‘charming!’ every now and then; and they\n",
      "probably would have decided him to ‘go in’ for Jerusalem again to-morrow\n",
      "morning, had he been less curious respecting Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is there nothing,’ he thought, glancing at her as she sat at the head of\n",
      "the table, where her youthful figure, small and slight, but very\n",
      "graceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; ‘is there nothing that\n",
      "will move that face?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes!  By Jupiter, there was something, and here it was, in an unexpected\n",
      "shape.  Tom appeared.  She changed as the door opened, and broke into a\n",
      "beaming smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "A beautiful smile.  Mr. James Harthouse might not have thought so much of\n",
      "it, but that he had wondered so long at her impassive face.  She put out\n",
      "her hand—a pretty little soft hand; and her fingers closed upon her\n",
      "brother’s, as if she would have carried them to her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ay, ay?’ thought the visitor.  ‘This whelp is the only creature she\n",
      "cares for.  So, so!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The whelp was presented, and took his chair.  The appellation was not\n",
      "flattering, but not unmerited.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When I was your age, young Tom,’ said Bounderby, ‘I was punctual, or I\n",
      "got no dinner!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When you were my age,’ resumed Tom, ‘you hadn’t a wrong balance to get\n",
      "right, and hadn’t to dress afterwards.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Never mind that now,’ said Bounderby.\n",

      "‘Well, then,’ grumbled Tom.  ‘Don’t begin with me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ said Harthouse, perfectly hearing this under-strain as\n",
      "it went on; ‘your brother’s face is quite familiar to me.  Can I have\n",
      "seen him abroad?  Or at some public school, perhaps?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ she resumed, quite interested, ‘he has never been abroad yet, and\n",
      "was educated here, at home.  Tom, love, I am telling Mr. Harthouse that\n",
      "he never saw you abroad.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No such luck, sir,’ said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was little enough in him to brighten her face, for he was a sullen\n",
      "young fellow, and ungracious in his manner even to her.  So much the\n",
      "greater must have been the solitude of her heart, and her need of some\n",
      "one on whom to bestow it.  ‘So much the more is this whelp the only\n",
      "creature she has ever cared for,’ thought Mr. James Harthouse, turning it\n",
      "over and over.  ‘So much the more.  So much the more.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Both in his sister’s presence, and after she had left the room, the whelp\n",
      "took no pains to hide his contempt for Mr. Bounderby, whenever he could\n",
      "indulge it without the observation of that independent man, by making wry\n",
      "faces, or shutting one eye.  Without responding to these telegraphic\n",
      "communications, Mr. Harthouse encouraged him much in the course of the\n",
      "evening, and showed an unusual liking for him.  At last, when he rose to\n",
      "return to his hotel, and was a little doubtful whether he knew the way by\n",
      "night, the whelp immediately proffered his services as guide, and turned\n",
      "out with him to escort him thither.\n",

      "IT was very remarkable that a young gentleman who had been brought up\n",
      "under one continuous system of unnatural restraint, should be a\n",
      "hypocrite; but it was certainly the case with Tom.  It was very strange\n",
      "that a young gentleman who had never been left to his own guidance for\n",
      "five consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing\n",
      "himself; but so it was with Tom.  It was altogether unaccountable that a\n",
      "young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle,\n",
      "should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling\n",
      "sensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you smoke?’ asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I believe you!’ said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up.\n",
      "What with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as\n",
      "cool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts;\n",
      "Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and\n",
      "more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and\n",
      "took an observation of his friend.  ‘He don’t seem to care about his\n",
      "dress,’ thought Tom, ‘and yet how capitally he does it.  What an easy\n",
      "swell he is!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom’s eye, remarked that he drank\n",
      "nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank’ee,’ said Tom.  ‘Thank’ee.  Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have\n",
      "had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.’  Tom said this with one eye\n",
      "shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A very good fellow indeed!’ returned Mr. James Harthouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You think so, don’t you?’ said Tom.  And shut up his eye again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and\n",
      "lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before\n",
      "the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at\n",
      "him, observed:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a comical brother-in-law you are!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,’ said\n",
      "Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are a piece of caustic, Tom,’ retorted Mr. James Harthouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a\n",
      "waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice;\n",
      "in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers;\n",
      "that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh!  I don’t care for old Bounderby,’ said he, ‘if you mean that.  I\n",
      "have always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked\n",
      "about him, and I have always thought of him in the same way.  I am not\n",
      "going to begin to be polite now, about old Bounderby.  It would be rather\n",
      "late in the day.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t mind me,’ returned James; ‘but take care when his wife is by, you\n",
      "know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘His wife?’ said Tom.  ‘My sister Loo?  O yes!’  And he laughed, and took\n",
      "a little more of the cooling drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude,\n",
      "smoking his cigar in his own easy way, and looking pleasantly at the\n",
      "whelp, as if he knew himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only\n",
      "to hover over him, and he must give up his whole soul if required.  It\n",
      "certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence.  He looked\n",
      "at his companion sneakingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at\n",
      "him boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My sister Loo?’ said Tom.  ‘_She_ never cared for old Bounderby.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s the past tense, Tom,’ returned Mr. James Harthouse, striking the\n",
      "ash from his cigar with his little finger.  ‘We are in the present tense,\n",
      "now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Verb neuter, not to care.  Indicative mood, present tense.  First person\n",
      "singular, I do not care; second person singular, thou dost not care;\n",
      "third person singular, she does not care,’ returned Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good!  Very quaint!’ said his friend.  ‘Though you don’t mean it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I _do_ mean it,’ cried Tom.  ‘Upon my honour!  Why, you won’t tell\n",
      "me, Mr. Harthouse, that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for\n",
      "old Bounderby.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear fellow,’ returned the other, ‘what am I bound to suppose, when I\n",
      "find two married people living in harmony and happiness?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa.  If his second leg\n",
      "had not been already there when he was called a dear fellow, he would\n",
      "have put it up at that great stage of the conversation.  Feeling it\n",
      "necessary to do something then, he stretched himself out at greater\n",
      "length, and, reclining with the back of his head on the end of the sofa,\n",
      "and smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common\n",
      "face, and not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so\n",
      "carelessly yet so potently.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,’ said Tom, ‘and therefore, you\n",
      "needn’t be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby.  She never had a\n",
      "lover, and the governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very dutiful in your interesting sister,’ said Mr. James Harthouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, but she wouldn’t have been as dutiful, and it would not have come\n",

      "The tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_I_ persuaded her,’ he said, with an edifying air of superiority.  ‘I\n",
      "was stuck into old Bounderby’s bank (where I never wanted to be), and I\n",
      "knew I should get into scrapes there, if she put old Bounderby’s pipe\n",
      "out; so I told her my wishes, and she came into them.  She would do\n",

      "A girl can get on anywhere.  She has settled down to the life, and _she_\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Calling at the Bank yesterday evening, for Mr. Bounderby’s address, I\n",

      "of a voice saying: ‘Come, it’s late.  Be off!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well!’ he said, scrambling from the sofa.  ‘I must take my leave of you\n",

      "The first four days of his endurance were days so long and heavy, that he\n",

      "although he knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the\n",
      "women working in the factories, he found that some of them with whom he\n",
      "was acquainted were changed to him, and he feared to try others, and\n",
      "dreaded that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if she were\n",
      "seen in his company.  So, he had been quite alone during the four days,\n",

      "‘Nay, ma’am,’ said Stephen Blackpool, staunchly protesting against the\n",
      "words that had been used, and instinctively addressing himself to Louisa,\n",

      "visiting time is later this year than usual, for I have been rather\n",
      "troubled with shortness of breath, and so put it off till the weather was\n",
      "fine and warm.  For the same reason I don’t make all my journey in one\n",
      "day, but divide it into two days, and get a bed to-night at the\n",
      "Travellers’ Coffee House down by the railroad (a nice clean house), and\n",
      "go back Parliamentary, at six in the morning.  Well, but what has this to\n",
      "do with this good lass, says you?  I’m going to tell you.  I have heard\n",
      "of Mr. Bounderby being married.  I read it in the paper, where it looked\n",
      "grand—oh, it looked fine!’ the old woman dwelt on it with strange\n",
      "enthusiasm: ‘and I want to see his wife.  I have never seen her yet.\n",
      "Now, if you’ll believe me, she hasn’t come out of that house since noon\n",
      "to-day.  So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about, a little\n",
      "last bit more, when I passed close to this good lass two or three times;\n",
      "and her face being so friendly I spoke to her, and she spoke to me.\n",
      "There!’ said the old woman to Stephen, ‘you can make all the rest out for\n",
      "yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike\n",
      "this old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner\n",
      "possibly could be.  With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he\n",
      "knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in\n",
      "her old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, missus,’ said he, ‘I ha seen the lady, and she were young and\n",
      "hansom.  Wi’ fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha\n",
      "never seen the like on.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Young and handsome.  Yes!’ cried the old woman, quite delighted.  ‘As\n",
      "bonny as a rose!  And what a happy wife!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Aye, missus, I suppose she be,’ said Stephen.  But with a doubtful\n",
      "glance at Rachael.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Suppose she be?  She must be.  She’s your master’s wife,’ returned the\n",
      "old woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen nodded assent.  ‘Though as to master,’ said he, glancing again at\n",
      "Rachael, ‘not master onny more.  That’s aw enden ’twixt him and me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you left his work, Stephen?’ asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, Rachael,’ he replied, ‘whether I ha lef’n his work, or whether his\n",
      "work ha lef’n me, cooms t’ th’ same.  His work and me are parted.  ’Tis\n",
      "as weel so—better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi’ me.  It would ha\n",
      "brought’n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer.  Haply ’tis a\n",
      "kindness to monny that I go; haply ’tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it\n",
      "mun be done.  I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th’ time, and seek a\n",
      "fort’n, dear, by beginnin fresh.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where will you go, Stephen?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I donno t’night,’ said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin\n",
      "hair with the flat of his hand.  ‘But I’m not goin t’night, Rachael, nor\n",
      "yet t’morrow.  ’Tan’t easy overmuch t’ know wheer t’ turn, but a good\n",
      "heart will coom to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him.  Before he\n",
      "had so much as closed Mr. Bounderby’s door, he had reflected that at\n",
      "least his being obliged to go away was good for her, as it would save her\n",
      "from the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from\n",
      "him.  Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her, and though he\n",
      "could think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not\n",
      "pursue him, perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the\n",
      "endurance of the last four days, even to unknown difficulties and\n",
      "distresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he said, with truth, ‘I’m more leetsome, Rachael, under ’t, than I\n",
      "could’n ha believed.’  It was not her part to make his burden heavier.\n",
      "She answered with her comforting smile, and the three walked on together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds\n",
      "much consideration among the poor.  The old woman was so decent and\n",
      "contented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had\n",
      "increased upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that they\n",
      "both took an interest in her.  She was too sprightly to allow of their\n",
      "walking at a slow pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be\n",
      "talked to, and very willing to talk to any extent: so, when they came to\n",
      "their part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come to my poor place, missus,’ said Stephen, ‘and tak a coop o’ tea.\n",
      "Rachael will coom then; and arterwards I’ll see thee safe t’ thy\n",
      "Travellers’ lodgin.  ’T may be long, Rachael, ere ever I ha th’ chance o’\n",
      "thy coompany agen.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They complied, and the three went on to the house where he lodged.  When\n",
      "they turned into a narrow street, Stephen glanced at his window with a\n",
      "dread that always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as he had\n",
      "left it, and no one was there.  The evil spirit of his life had flitted\n",
      "away again, months ago, and he had heard no more of her since.  The only\n",
      "evidence of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in his room,\n",
      "and the grayer hair upon his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot water from\n",
      "below, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some\n",
      "butter from the nearest shop.  The bread was new and crusty, the butter\n",
      "fresh, and the sugar lump, of course—in fulfilment of the standard\n",
      "testimony of the Coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes,\n",
      "sir.  Rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing\n",
      "of a cup), and the visitor enjoyed it mightily.  It was the first glimpse\n",
      "of sociality the host had had for many days.  He too, with the world a\n",
      "wide heath before him, enjoyed the meal—again in corroboration of the\n",
      "magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of\n",
      "these people, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I ha never thowt yet, missus,’ said Stephen, ‘o’ askin thy name.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The old lady announced herself as ‘Mrs. Pegler.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A widder, I think?’ said Stephen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, many long years!’  Mrs. Pegler’s husband (one of the best on record)\n",
      "was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler’s calculation, when Stephen was born.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘’Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,’ said Stephen.  ‘Onny\n",
      "children?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Pegler’s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted\n",
      "some nervousness on her part.  ‘No,’ she said.  ‘Not now, not now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dead, Stephen,’ Rachael softly hinted.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m sooary I ha spok’n on ’t,’ said Stephen, ‘I ought t’ hadn in my mind\n",
      "as I might touch a sore place.  I—I blame myseln.’\n",
      "\n",
      "While he excused himself, the old lady’s cup rattled more and more.  ‘I\n",
      "had a son,’ she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual\n",
      "appearances of sorrow; ‘and he did well, wonderfully well.  But he is not\n",
      "to be spoken of if you please.  He is—’  Putting down her cup, she moved\n",
      "her hands as if she would have added, by her action, ‘dead!’  Then she\n",
      "said aloud, ‘I have lost him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain,\n",
      "when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to\n",
      "the door, whispered in his ear.  Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for\n",
      "she caught a word as it was uttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bounderby!’ she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the\n",
      "table.  ‘Oh hide me!  Don’t let me be seen for the world.  Don’t let him\n",
      "come up till I’ve got away.  Pray, pray!’  She trembled, and was\n",
      "excessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to\n",
      "reassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But hearken, missus, hearken,’ said Stephen, astonished.  ‘’Tisn’t Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby; ’tis his wife.  Yo’r not fearfo’ o’ her.  Yo was hey-go-mad\n",
      "about her, but an hour sin.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But are you sure it’s the lady, and not the gentleman?’ she asked, still\n",
      "trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Certain sure!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well then, pray don’t speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,’ said\n",
      "the old woman.  ‘Let me be quite to myself in this corner.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which she was\n",
      "quite unable to give him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few\n",
      "moments returned, lighting Louisa into the room.  She was followed by the\n",
      "whelp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand,\n",
      "when Stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle\n",
      "on the table.  Then he too stood, with his doubled hand upon the table\n",
      "near it, waiting to be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings\n",
      "of the Coketown Hands; for the first time in her life she was face to\n",
      "face with anything like individuality in connection with them.  She knew\n",
      "of their existence by hundreds and by thousands.  She knew what results\n",
      "in work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time.\n",
      "She knew them in crowds passing to and from their nests, like ants or\n",
      "beetles.  But she knew from her reading infinitely more of the ways of\n",
      "toiling insects than of these toiling men and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something to be worked so much and paid so much, and there ended;\n",
      "something to be infallibly settled by laws of supply and demand;\n",
      "something that blundered against those laws, and floundered into\n",
      "difficulty; something that was a little pinched when wheat was dear, and\n",
      "over-ate itself when wheat was cheap; something that increased at such a\n",
      "rate of percentage, and yielded such another percentage of crime, and\n",
      "such another percentage of pauperism; something wholesale, of which vast\n",
      "fortunes were made; something that occasionally rose like a sea, and did\n",
      "some harm and waste (chiefly to itself), and fell again; this she knew\n",
      "the Coketown Hands to be.  But, she had scarcely thought more of\n",
      "separating them into units, than of separating the sea itself into its\n",
      "component drops.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood for some moments looking round the room.  From the few chairs,\n",
      "the few books, the common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two\n",
      "women, and to Stephen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.  I\n",
      "should like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me.  Is this your\n",
      "wife?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I remember,’ said Louisa, reddening at her mistake; ‘I recollect, now,\n",
      "to have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though I was not\n",
      "attending to the particulars at the time.  It was not my meaning to ask a\n",
      "question that would give pain to any one here.  If I should ask any other\n",
      "question that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you\n",
      "please, for being in ignorance how to speak to you as I ought.’\n",
      "\n",
      "As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to\n",
      "her, so she now instinctively addressed herself to Rachael.  Her manner\n",
      "was short and abrupt, yet faltering and timid.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?  You\n",
      "would be his first resource, I think.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have heard the end of it, young lady,’ said Rachael.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did I understand, that, being rejected by one employer, he would\n",
      "probably be rejected by all?  I thought he said as much?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The chances are very small, young lady—next to nothing—for a man who\n",
      "gets a bad name among them.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The name of being troublesome.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the\n",
      "other, he is sacrificed alike?  Are the two so deeply separated in this\n",
      "town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between\n",
      "them?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachael shook her head in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He fell into suspicion,’ said Louisa, ‘with his fellow-weavers,\n",
      "because—he had made a promise not to be one of them.  I think it must\n",
      "have been to you that he made that promise.  Might I ask you why he made\n",
      "it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachael burst into tears.  ‘I didn’t seek it of him, poor lad.  I prayed\n",
      "him to avoid trouble for his own good, little thinking he’d come to it\n",
      "through me.  But I know he’d die a hundred deaths, ere ever he’d break\n",
      "his word.  I know that of him well.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual thoughtful attitude,\n",
      "with his hand at his chin.  He now spoke in a voice rather less steady\n",
      "than usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, an’ what love, an’\n",
      "respect, I bear to Rachael, or wi’ what cause.  When I passed that\n",
      "promess, I towd her true, she were th’ Angel o’ my life.  ’Twere a solemn\n",
      "promess.  ’Tis gone fro’ me, for ever.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference that was new\n",
      "in her.  She looked from him to Rachael, and her features softened.\n",
      "‘What will you do?’ she asked him.  And her voice had softened too.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Weel, ma’am,’ said Stephen, making the best of it, with a smile; ‘when I\n",
      "ha finished off, I mun quit this part, and try another.  Fortnet or\n",
      "misfortnet, a man can but try; there’s nowt to be done wi’out tryin’—cept\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.  The rustling of a\n",
      "bank-note was audible, as she unfolded one and laid it on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Rachael, will you tell him—for you know how, without offence—that this\n",
      "is freely his, to help him on his way?  Will you entreat him to take it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I canna do that, young lady,’ she answered, turning her head aside.\n",
      "‘Bless you for thinking o’ the poor lad wi’ such tenderness.  But ’tis\n",
      "for him to know his heart, and what is right according to it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome\n",
      "with quick sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who had been\n",
      "so plain and steady through the late interview, lost his composure in a\n",
      "moment, and now stood with his hand before his face.  She stretched out\n",
      "hers, as if she would have touched him; then checked herself, and\n",
      "remained still.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not e’en Rachael,’ said Stephen, when he stood again with his face\n",
      "uncovered, ‘could mak sitch a kind offerin, by onny words, kinder.  T’\n",
      "show that I’m not a man wi’out reason and gratitude, I’ll tak two pound.\n",
      "I’ll borrow ’t for t’ pay ’t back.  ’Twill be the sweetest work as ever I\n",

      "She was fain to take up the note again, and to substitute the much\n",
      "smaller sum he had named.  He was neither courtly, nor handsome, nor\n",
      "picturesque, in any respect; and yet his manner of accepting it, and of\n",
      "expressing his thanks without more words, had a grace in it that Lord\n",
      "Chesterfield could not have taught his son in a century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick\n",
      "with sufficient unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage.\n",
      "Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put\n",
      "in a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just wait a moment, Loo!  Before we go, I should like to speak to him a\n",
      "moment.  Something comes into my head.  If you’ll step out on the stairs,\n",
      "Blackpool, I’ll mention it.  Never mind a light, man!’  Tom was\n",
      "remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one.  ‘It\n",
      "don’t want a light.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock\n",
      "in his hand.\n",

      "your room—but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there’s\n",

      "Don’t take on, as if you meant anything, if he should see you hanging\n",
      "about there; because I shan’t put him up to speak to you, unless I find I\n",
      "can do you the service I want to do you.  In that case he’ll have a note\n",
      "or a message for you, but not else.  Now look here!  You are sure you\n",

      "empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank, on each of the\n",
      "two first evenings; and nothing had happened there, good or bad.  That he\n",

      "blind below which had BANK upon it, and sometimes coming to the door and\n",
      "standing on the steps for a breath of air.  When he first came out,\n",
      "Stephen thought he might be looking for him, and passed near; but the\n",
      "light porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly, and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day’s\n",
      "labour.  Stephen sat upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under\n",
      "an archway, strolled up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped\n",
      "and watched children playing in the street.  Some purpose or other is so\n",
      "natural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels\n",
      "remarkable.  When the first hour was out, Stephen even began to have an\n",
      "uncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable\n",
      "character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light all down\n",
      "the long perspective of the street, until they were blended and lost in\n",
      "the distance.  Mrs. Sparsit closed the first-floor window, drew down the\n",
      "blind, and went up-stairs.  Presently, a light went up-stairs after her,\n",
      "passing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase\n",
      "windows, on its way up.  By and by, one corner of the second-floor blind\n",
      "was disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit’s eye were there; also the other\n",
      "corner, as if the light porter’s eye were on that side.  Still, no\n",
      "communication was made to Stephen.  Much relieved when the two hours were\n",
      "at last accomplished, he went away at a quick pace, as a recompense for\n",
      "so much loitering.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had only to take leave of his landlady, and lie down on his temporary\n",
      "bed upon the floor; for his bundle was made up for to-morrow, and all was\n",
      "arranged for his departure.  He meant to be clear of the town very early;\n",
      "before the Hands were in the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look round his room,\n",
      "mournfully wondering whether he should ever see it again, he went out.\n",
      "The town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it,\n",
      "rather than hold communication with him.  Everything looked wan at that\n",

      "built up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens\n",
      "were sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by\n",
      "coal-dust paths and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got to the top of\n",
      "the hill, and looked back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day was shining radiantly upon the town then, and the bells were going\n",
      "for the morning work.  Domestic fires were not yet lighted, and the high\n",
      "chimneys had the sky to themselves.  Puffing out their poisonous volumes,\n",
      "they would not be long in hiding it; but, for half an hour, some of the\n",
      "many windows were golden, which showed the Coketown people a sun\n",
      "eternally in eclipse, through a medium of smoked glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds.  So strange, to have\n",

      "lived to his time of life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer\n",
      "morning!  With these musings in his mind, and his bundle under his arm,\n",

      "MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE, ‘going in’ for his adopted party, soon began to\n",
      "score.  With the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages, a\n",
      "little more genteel listlessness for the general society, and a tolerable\n",
      "management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty, most effective and most\n",
      "patronized of the polite deadly sins, he speedily came to be considered\n",
      "of much promise.  The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand\n",
      "point in his favour, enabling him to take to the hard Fact fellows with\n",
      "as good a grace as if he had been born one of the tribe, and to throw all\n",
      "other tribes overboard, as conscious hypocrites.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Whom none of us believe, my dear Mrs. Bounderby, and who do not believe\n",
      "themselves.  The only difference between us and the professors of virtue\n",
      "or benevolence, or philanthropy—never mind the name—is, that we know it\n",
      "is all meaningless, and say so; while they know it equally and will never\n",
      "say so.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration?  It was not so\n",
      "unlike her father’s principles, and her early training, that it need\n",
      "startle her.  Where was the great difference between the two schools,\n",
      "when each chained her down to material realities, and inspired her with\n",
      "no faith in anything else?  What was there in her soul for James\n",
      "Harthouse to destroy, which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its\n",
      "state of innocence!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her mind—implanted\n",
      "there before her eminently practical father began to form it—a struggling\n",
      "disposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever\n",
      "heard of, constantly strove with doubts and resentments.  With doubts,\n",
      "because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth.  With\n",
      "resentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it were\n",
      "indeed a whisper of the truth.  Upon a nature long accustomed to\n",
      "self-suppression, thus torn and divided, the Harthouse philosophy came as\n",
      "a relief and justification.  Everything being hollow and worthless, she\n",
      "had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing.  What did it matter, she had\n",
      "said to her father, when he proposed her husband.  What did it matter,\n",
      "she said still.  With a scornful self-reliance, she asked herself, What\n",
      "did anything matter—and went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards what?  Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet\n",
      "so gradually, that she believed herself to remain motionless.  As to Mr.\n",
      "Harthouse, whither _he_ tended, he neither considered nor cared.  He had\n",
      "no particular design or plan before him: no energetic wickedness ruffled\n",
      "his lassitude.  He was as much amused and interested, at present, as it\n",
      "became so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even more than it would have\n",
      "been consistent with his reputation to confess.  Soon after his arrival\n",
      "he languidly wrote to his brother, the honourable and jocular member,\n",
      "that the Bounderbys were ‘great fun;’ and further, that the female\n",
      "Bounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was young, and\n",
      "remarkably pretty.  After that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted\n",
      "his leisure chiefly to their house.  He was very often in their house, in\n",
      "his flittings and visitings about the Coketown district; and was much\n",
      "encouraged by Mr. Bounderby.  It was quite in Mr. Bounderby’s gusty way\n",
      "to boast to all his world that _he_ didn’t care about your highly\n",
      "connected people, but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind’s daughter did, she\n",
      "was welcome to their company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation, if the\n",
      "face which changed so beautifully for the whelp, would change for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did not forget\n",
      "a word of the brother’s revelations.  He interwove them with everything\n",
      "he saw of the sister, and he began to understand her.  To be sure, the\n",
      "better and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of\n",
      "perception; for in natures, as in seas, depth answers unto depth; but he\n",
      "soon began to read the rest with a student’s eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds, about fifteen\n",
      "miles from the town, and accessible within a mile or two, by a railway\n",
      "striding on many arches over a wild country, undermined by deserted\n",
      "coal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary\n",
      "engines at pits’ mouths.  This country, gradually softening towards the\n",
      "neighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby’s retreat, there mellowed into a rustic\n",
      "landscape, golden with heath, and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of\n",
      "the year, and tremulous with leaves and their shadows all the summer\n",
      "time.  The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus\n",
      "pleasantly situated, by one of the Coketown magnates, who, in his\n",
      "determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune,\n",
      "overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds.  These\n",
      "accidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of\n",
      "Coketown, but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the\n",
      "improvident classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this\n",
      "snug little estate, and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in\n",
      "the flower-garden.  He delighted to live, barrack-fashion, among the\n",
      "elegant furniture, and he bullied the very pictures with his origin.\n",
      "‘Why, sir,’ he would say to a visitor, ‘I am told that Nickits,’ the late\n",
      "owner, ‘gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach.  Now, to be plain\n",
      "with you, if I ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks at\n",
      "it, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as I shall do.  No, by\n",
      "George!  I don’t forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  For\n",
      "years upon years, the only pictures in my possession, or that I could\n",
      "have got into my possession, by any means, unless I stole ’em, were the\n",
      "engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot, on the blacking bottles\n",
      "that I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and that I sold when\n",
      "they were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad to get it!’\n",

      "Then he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here.  Bring half a dozen\n",
      "more if you like, and we’ll find room for ’em.  There’s stabling in this\n",
      "place for a dozen horses; and unless Nickits is belied, he kept the full\n",
      "number.  A round dozen of ’em, sir.  When that man was a boy, he went to\n",
      "Westminster School.  Went to Westminster School as a King’s Scholar, when\n",
      "I was principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market baskets.\n",
      "Why, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses—which I don’t, for one’s enough\n",
      "for me—I couldn’t bear to see ’em in their stalls here, and think what my\n",
      "own lodging used to be.  I couldn’t look at ’em, sir, and not order ’em\n",
      "out.  Yet so things come round.  You see this place; you know what sort\n",
      "of a place it is; you are aware that there’s not a completer place of its\n",
      "size in this kingdom or elsewhere—I don’t care where—and here, got into\n",
      "the middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is Josiah Bounderby.  While\n",
      "Nickits (as a man came into my office, and told me yesterday), Nickits,\n",
      "who used to act in Latin, in the Westminster School plays, with the\n",
      "chief-justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were\n",
      "black in the face, is drivelling at this minute—drivelling, sir!—in a\n",
      "fifth floor, up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was among the leafy shadows of this retirement, in the long sultry\n",
      "summer days, that Mr. Harthouse began to prove the face which had set him\n",
      "wondering when he first saw it, and to try if it would change for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Bounderby, I esteem it a most fortunate accident that I find you\n",
      "alone here.  I have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not by any wonderful accident that he found her, the time of day\n",
      "being that at which she was always alone, and the place being her\n",
      "favourite resort.  It was an opening in a dark wood, where some felled\n",
      "trees lay, and where she would sit watching the fallen leaves of last\n",
      "year, as she had watched the falling ashes at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down beside her, with a glance at her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your brother.  My young friend Tom—’\n",
      "\n",
      "Her colour brightened, and she turned to him with a look of interest.  ‘I\n",
      "never in my life,’ he thought, ‘saw anything so remarkable and so\n",
      "captivating as the lighting of those features!’  His face betrayed his\n",
      "thoughts—perhaps without betraying him, for it might have been according\n",
      "to its instructions so to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pardon me.  The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful—Tom\n",
      "should be so proud of it—I know this is inexcusable, but I am so\n",
      "compelled to admire.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Being so impulsive,’ she said composedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Bounderby, no: you know I make no pretence with you.  You know I am\n",
      "a sordid piece of human nature, ready to sell myself at any time for any\n",
      "reasonable sum, and altogether incapable of any Arcadian proceeding\n",
      "whatever.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am waiting,’ she returned, ‘for your further reference to my brother.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are rigid with me, and I deserve it.  I am as worthless a dog as you\n",
      "will find, except that I am not false—not false.  But you surprised and\n",
      "started me from my subject, which was your brother.  I have an interest\n",
      "in him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?’ she asked, half\n",
      "incredulously and half gratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you had asked me when I first came here, I should have said no.  I\n",
      "must say now—even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence, and of\n",
      "justly awakening your incredulity—yes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She made a slight movement, as if she were trying to speak, but could not\n",
      "find voice; at length she said, ‘Mr. Harthouse, I give you credit for\n",
      "being interested in my brother.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you.  I claim to deserve it.  You know how little I do claim, but\n",
      "I will go that length.  You have done so much for him, you are so fond of\n",
      "him; your whole life, Mrs. Bounderby, expresses such charming\n",
      "self-forgetfulness on his account—pardon me again—I am running wide of\n",
      "the subject.  I am interested in him for his own sake.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She had made the slightest action possible, as if she would have risen in\n",
      "a hurry and gone away.  He had turned the course of what he said at that\n",
      "instant, and she remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ he resumed, in a lighter manner, and yet with a show of\n",
      "effort in assuming it, which was even more expressive than the manner he\n",
      "dismissed; ‘it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your\n",
      "brother’s years, if he is heedless, inconsiderate, and expensive—a little\n",
      "dissipated, in the common phrase.  Is he?’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat, looking down; but, at this question, raised her eyes searchingly\n",
      "and a little resentfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs. Bounderby.  I think Tom\n",

      "again, for his sake?  Is that necessary?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me,’ said James\n",
      "Harthouse, again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more\n",
      "airy manner; ‘I will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many\n",

      "She flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she replied in a\n",
      "fainter voice, ‘I do not think that likely, either.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mrs. Bounderby,’ said Harthouse, after a short silence, ‘may there be a\n",

      "considerable sum of you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You will understand, Mr. Harthouse,’ she returned, after some\n",
      "indecision: she had been more or less uncertain, and troubled throughout\n",
      "the conversation, and yet had in the main preserved her self-contained\n",
      "manner; ‘you will understand that if I tell you what you press to know,\n",
      "it is not by way of complaint or regret.  I would never complain of\n",
      "anything, and what I have done I do not in the least regret.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So spirited, too!’ thought James Harthouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When I married, I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in\n",
      "debt.  Heavily for him, I mean.  Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some\n",
      "trinkets.  They were no sacrifice.  I sold them very willingly.  I\n",
      "attached no value to them.  They, were quite worthless to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Either she saw in his face that he knew, or she only feared in her\n",
      "conscience that he knew, that she spoke of some of her husband’s gifts.\n",
      "She stopped, and reddened again.  If he had not known it before, he would\n",
      "have known it then, though he had been a much duller man than he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Since then, I have given my brother, at various times, what money I\n",

      "on the faith of the interest you profess for him, I will not do so by\n",
      "halves.  Since you have been in the habit of visiting here, he has wanted\n",
      "in one sum as much as a hundred pounds.  I have not been able to give it\n",
      "to him.  I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so\n",
      "involved, but I have kept these secrets until now, when I trust them to\n",
      "your honour.  I have held no confidence with any one, because—you\n",
      "anticipated my reason just now.’  She abruptly broke off.\n",
      "\n",

      "consideration with which you regard his errors.  With all possible\n",
      "respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby, I think I perceive\n",
      "that he has not been fortunate in his training.  Bred at a disadvantage\n",
      "towards the society in which he has his part to play, he rushes into\n",
      "these extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have long been\n",
      "forced—with the very best intentions we have no doubt—upon him.  Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby’s fine bluff English independence, though a most charming\n",
      "characteristic, does not—as we have agreed—invite confidence.  If I might\n",
      "venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that\n",
      "delicacy to which a youth mistaken, a character misconceived, and\n",
      "abilities misdirected, would turn for relief and guidance, I should\n",
      "express what it presents to my own view.’\n",
      "\n",
      "As she sat looking straight before her, across the changing lights upon\n",
      "the grass into the darkness of the wood beyond, he saw in her face her\n",
      "application of his very distinctly uttered words.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All allowance,’ he continued, ‘must be made.  I have one great fault to\n",

      "heavily to account.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps,’ he returned, ‘I have said enough.  Perhaps it would have been\n",

      "‘To relieve you from needless apprehension—and as this confidence\n",
      "regarding your brother, which I prize I am sure above all possible\n",
      "things, has been established between us—I obey.  I cannot forgive him for\n",
      "not being more sensible in every word, look, and act of his life, of the\n",
      "affection of his best friend; of the devotion of his best friend; of her\n",
      "unselfishness; of her sacrifice.  The return he makes her, within my\n",
      "observation, is a very poor one.  What she has done for him demands his\n",
      "constant love and gratitude, not his ill-humour and caprice.  Careless\n",
      "fellow as I am, I am not so indifferent, Mrs. Bounderby, as to be\n",
      "regardless of this vice in your brother, or inclined to consider it a\n",
      "venial offence.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood floated before her, for her eyes were suffused with tears.  They\n",
      "rose from a deep well, long concealed, and her heart was filled with\n",
      "acute pain that found no relief in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs. Bounderby, that I\n",
      "must aspire.  My better knowledge of his circumstances, and my direction\n",
      "and advice in extricating them—rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a\n",
      "scapegrace on a much larger scale—will give me some influence over him,\n",
      "and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.  I have said\n",
      "enough, and more than enough.  I seem to be protesting that I am a sort\n",
      "of good fellow, when, upon my honour, I have not the least intention to\n",
      "make any protestation to that effect, and openly announce that I am\n",
      "nothing of the sort.  Yonder, among the trees,’ he added, having lifted\n",

      "loitering in this direction, it may be as well, perhaps, to walk towards\n",
      "him, and throw ourselves in his way.  He has been very silent and doleful\n",
      "of late.  Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched—if there are such\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mercenary,’ repeated Tom.  ‘Who is not mercenary?  Ask my sister.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?’ said Louisa,\n",
      "showing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature.\n",

      "better.  I shall disclose some of his opinions of you, privately\n",
      "expressed to me, unless he relents a little.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘At all events, Mr. Harthouse,’ said Tom, softening in his admiration of\n",
      "his patron, but shaking his head sullenly too, ‘you can’t tell her that I\n",
      "ever praised her for being mercenary.  I may have praised her for being\n",
      "the contrary, and I should do it again, if I had as good reason.\n",
      "However, never mind this now; it’s not very interesting to you, and I am\n",
      "sick of the subject.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked on to the house, where Louisa quitted her visitor’s arm and\n",
      "went in.  He stood looking after her, as she ascended the steps, and\n",
      "passed into the shadow of the door; then put his hand upon her brother’s\n",

      "They had stopped among a disorder of roses—it was part of Mr. Bounderby’s\n",
      "humility to keep Nickits’s roses on a reduced scale—and Tom sat down on a\n",
      "terrace-parapet, plucking buds and picking them to pieces; while his\n",
      "powerful Familiar stood over him, with a foot upon the parapet, and his\n",
      "figure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee.  They were just\n",
      "visible from her window.  Perhaps she saw them.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tom, what’s the matter?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh!  Mr. Harthouse,’ said Tom with a groan, ‘I am hard up, and bothered\n",

      "\n",
      "‘My good fellow, so am I.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You!’ returned Tom.  ‘You are the picture of independence.  Mr.\n",
      "Harthouse, I am in a horrible mess.  You have no idea what a state I have\n",
      "got myself into—what a state my sister might have got me out of, if she\n",
      "would only have done it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from his teeth\n",
      "with a hand that trembled like an infirm old man’s.  After one\n",
      "exceedingly observant look at him, his companion relapsed into his\n",
      "lightest air.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your sister.  You\n",
      "have had money of her, you dog, you know you have.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have.  How else was I to get it?  Here’s\n",
      "old Bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a\n",
      "month, or something of that sort.  Here’s my father drawing what he calls\n",
      "a line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck and heels.  Here’s my\n",
      "mother who never has anything of her own, except her complaints.  What\n",
      "_is_ a fellow to do for money, and where _am_ I to look for it, if not to\n",
      "my sister?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He was almost crying, and scattered the buds about by dozens.  Mr.\n",
      "Harthouse took him persuasively by the coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not got it, Mr. Harthouse?  I don’t say she has got it.  I may have\n",
      "wanted more than she was likely to have got.  But then she ought to get\n",
      "it.  She could get it.  It’s of no use pretending to make a secret of\n",
      "matters now, after what I have told you already; you know she didn’t\n",
      "marry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his sake, but for my sake.\n",
      "Then why doesn’t she get what I want, out of him, for my sake?  She is\n",
      "not obliged to say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough;\n",
      "she could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose.  Then why doesn’t\n",
      "she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is?  But no.  There\n",
      "she sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable\n",
      "and getting it easily.  I don’t know what you may call this, but I call\n",
      "it unnatural conduct.’\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on\n",
      "the other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong\n",
      "inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as the injured men of\n",
      "Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic.  But he\n",
      "preserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone\n",
      "balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little\n",
      "surface-island.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Tom,’ said Harthouse, ‘let me try to be your banker.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For God’s sake,’ replied Tom, suddenly, ‘don’t talk about bankers!’  And\n",
      "very white he looked, in contrast with the roses.  Very white.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to the best\n",
      "society, was not to be surprised—he could as soon have been affected—but\n",
      "he raised his eyelids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble\n",
      "touch of wonder.  Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his\n",
      "school to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind\n",
      "College.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is the present need, Tom?  Three figures?  Out with them.  Say what\n",
      "they are.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Harthouse,’ returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were\n",
      "better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: ‘it’s too\n",
      "late; the money is of no use to me at present.  I should have had it\n",
      "before to be of use to me.  But I am very much obliged to you; you’re a\n",
      "true friend.’\n",
      "\n",
      "A true friend!  ‘Whelp, whelp!’ thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; ‘what an\n",
      "Ass you are!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And I take your offer as a great kindness,’ said Tom, grasping his hand.\n",
      "‘As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well,’ returned the other, ‘it may be of more use by and by.  And, my\n",
      "good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come\n",
      "thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find\n",
      "for yourself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you,’ said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds.\n",
      "‘I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, you see, Tom,’ said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing\n",
      "over a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always\n",
      "drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland:\n",
      "‘every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the\n",
      "rest of my fellow-creatures.  I am desperately intent;’ the languor of\n",
      "his desperation being quite tropical; ‘on your softening towards your\n",
      "sister—which you ought to do; and on your being a more loving and\n",
      "agreeable sort of brother—which you ought to be.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will be, Mr. Harthouse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No time like the present, Tom.  Begin at once.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Certainly I will.  And my sister Loo shall say so.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Having made which bargain, Tom,’ said Harthouse, clapping him on the\n",
      "shoulder again, with an air which left him at liberty to infer—as he did,\n",
      "poor fool—that this condition was imposed upon him in mere careless good\n",
      "nature to lessen his sense of obligation, ‘we will tear ourselves asunder\n",
      "until dinner-time.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Tom appeared before dinner, though his mind seemed heavy enough, his\n",
      "body was on the alert; and he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in.  ‘I\n",
      "didn’t mean to be cross, Loo,’ he said, giving her his hand, and kissing\n",
      "her.  ‘I know you are fond of me, and you know I am fond of you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, there was a smile upon Louisa’s face that day, for some one\n",
      "else.  Alas, for some one else!\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for,’\n",
      "thought James Harthouse, reversing the reflection of his first day’s\n",
      "knowledge of her pretty face.  ‘So much the less, so much the less.’\n",

      "EXPLOSION\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE next morning was too bright a morning for sleep, and James Harthouse\n",
      "rose early, and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing-room,\n",
      "smoking the rare tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his\n",
      "young friend.  Reposing in the sunlight, with the fragrance of his\n",
      "eastern pipe about him, and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air, so\n",
      "rich and soft with summer odours, he reckoned up his advantages as an\n",
      "idle winner might count his gains.  He was not at all bored for the time,\n",
      "and could give his mind to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had established a confidence with her, from which her husband was\n",
      "excluded.  He had established a confidence with her, that absolutely\n",
      "turned upon her indifference towards her husband, and the absence, now\n",
      "and at all times, of any congeniality between them.  He had artfully, but\n",
      "plainly, assured her that he knew her heart in its last most delicate\n",
      "recesses; he had come so near to her through its tenderest sentiment; he\n",
      "had associated himself with that feeling; and the barrier behind which\n",
      "she lived, had melted away.  All very odd, and very satisfactory!\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet he had not, even now, any earnest wickedness of purpose in him.\n",
      "Publicly and privately, it were much better for the age in which he\n",
      "lived, that he and the legion of whom he was one were designedly bad,\n",
      "than indifferent and purposeless.  It is the drifting icebergs setting\n",
      "with any current anywhere, that wreck the ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he goeth about in a shape\n",
      "by which few but savages and hunters are attracted.  But, when he is\n",
      "trimmed, smoothed, and varnished, according to the mode; when he is\n",
      "aweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to brimstone, and used\n",
      "up as to bliss; then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or\n",
      "to the kindling of red fire, he is the very Devil.\n",
      "\n",
      "So James Harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and\n",
      "reckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to\n",
      "be travelling.  The end to which it led was before him, pretty plainly;\n",
      "but he troubled himself with no calculations about it.  What will be,\n",
      "will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he had rather a long ride to take that day—for there was a public\n",
      "occasion ‘to do’ at some distance, which afforded a tolerable opportunity\n",
      "of going in for the Gradgrind men—he dressed early and went down to\n",
      "breakfast.  He was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous\n",
      "evening.  No.  He resumed where he had left off.  There was a look of\n",
      "interest for him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got through the day as much (or as little) to his own satisfaction, as\n",
      "was to be expected under the fatiguing circumstances; and came riding\n",
      "back at six o’clock.  There was a sweep of some half-mile between the\n",
      "lodge and the house, and he was riding along at a foot pace over the\n",
      "smooth gravel, once Nickits’s, when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the\n",
      "shrubbery, with such violence as to make his horse shy across the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Harthouse!’ cried Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Have you heard?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Heard what?’ said Harthouse, soothing his horse, and inwardly favouring\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby with no good wishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then you _haven’t_ heard!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have heard you, and so has this brute.  I have heard nothing else.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the centre of the path\n",
      "before the horse’s head, to explode his bombshell with more effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Bank’s robbed!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You don’t mean it!’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Of much?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it, really seemed\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Thank’ee,’ replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious manner.  ‘But I\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Here’s Tom Gradgrind’s daughter knows pretty well what it might have\n",
      "been, if you don’t,’ blustered Bounderby.  ‘Dropped, sir, as if she was\n",

      "credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She still looked faint and pale.  James Harthouse begged her to take his\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Why, I am going to tell you,’ said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm\n",
      "to Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘If you hadn’t been so mighty particular about the sum,\n",

      "\n",

      "knuckled his forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very well.  They live at the Bank.  You know they live at the Bank,\n",
      "perhaps?  Very well.  Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business\n",
      "hours, everything was put away as usual.  In the iron room that this\n",
      "young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much.  In the\n",
      "little safe in young Tom’s closet, the safe used for petty purposes,\n",
      "there was a hundred and fifty odd pound.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,’ said Bitzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come!’ retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, ‘let’s have\n",
      "none of _your_ interruptions.  It’s enough to be robbed while you’re\n",
      "snoring because you’re too comfortable, without being put right with\n",
      "_your_ four seven ones.  I didn’t snore, myself, when I was your age, let\n",
      "me tell you.  I hadn’t victuals enough to snore.  And I didn’t four seven\n",
      "one.  Not if I knew it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and seemed at\n",
      "once particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby’s moral abstinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A hundred and fifty odd pound,’ resumed Mr. Bounderby.  ‘That sum of\n",
      "money, young Tom locked in his safe, not a very strong safe, but that’s\n",
      "no matter now.  Everything was left, all right.  Some time in the night,\n",
      "while this young fellow snored—Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am, you say you have\n",
      "heard him snore?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I cannot say that I have heard him\n",
      "precisely snore, and therefore must not make that statement.  But on\n",
      "winter evenings, when he has fallen asleep at his table, I have heard\n",
      "him, what I should prefer to describe as partially choke.  I have heard\n",
      "him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be\n",
      "sometimes heard in Dutch clocks.  Not,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, with a lofty\n",
      "sense of giving strict evidence, ‘that I would convey any imputation on\n",
      "his moral character.  Far from it.  I have always considered Bitzer a\n",
      "young man of the most upright principle; and to that I beg to bear my\n",
      "testimony.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well!’ said the exasperated Bounderby, ‘while he was snoring, _or_\n",
      "choking, _or_ Dutch-clocking, _or_ something _or_ other—being asleep—some\n",
      "fellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not\n",
      "remains to be seen, got to young Tom’s safe, forced it, and abstracted\n",
      "the contents.  Being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves\n",
      "out at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked,\n",
      "and the key under Mrs. Sparsit’s pillow) with a false key, which was\n",
      "picked up in the street near the Bank, about twelve o’clock to-day.  No\n",
      "alarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and\n",
      "begins to open and prepare the offices for business.  Then, looking at\n",
      "Tom’s safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the\n",
      "money gone.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where is Tom, by the by?’ asked Harthouse, glancing round.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He has been helping the police,’ said Bounderby, ‘and stays behind at\n",
      "the Bank.  I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his\n",

      "\n",
      "Might Mr. Harthouse inquire Who was suspected?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well,’ said Bounderby, stopping and facing about to confront them all,\n",
      "‘I’ll tell you.  It’s not to be mentioned everywhere; it’s not to be\n",
      "mentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned (there’s a\n",
      "gang of ’em) may be thrown off their guard.  So take this in confidence.\n",
      "Now wait a bit.’  Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again.  ‘What should you\n",
      "say to;’ here he violently exploded: ‘to a Hand being in it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope,’ said Harthouse, lazily, ‘not our friend Blackpot?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,’ returned Bounderby, ‘and that’s the man.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O yes!  I know!’ said Bounderby, immediately catching at the sound.  ‘I\n",
      "know!  I am used to that.  I know all about it.  They are the finest\n",
      "people in the world, these fellows are.  They have got the gift of the\n",
      "gab, they have.  They only want to have their rights explained to them,\n",
      "they do.  But I tell you what.  Show me a dissatisfied Hand, and I’ll\n",
      "show you a man that’s fit for anything bad, I don’t care what it is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Another of the popular fictions of Coketown, which some pains had been\n",
      "taken to disseminate—and which some people really believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I am acquainted with these chaps,’ said Bounderby.  ‘I can read ’em\n",
      "off, like books.  Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am, I appeal to you.  What warning did\n",
      "I give that fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the\n",
      "express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over,\n",
      "and floor the Established Church?  Mrs. Sparsit, in point of high\n",
      "connexions, you are on a level with the aristocracy,—did I say, or did I\n",
      "not say, to that fellow, “you can’t hide the truth from me: you are not\n",
      "the kind of fellow I like; you’ll come to no good”?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Assuredly, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘you did, in a highly impressive\n",
      "manner, give him such an admonition.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When he shocked you, ma’am,’ said Bounderby; ‘when he shocked your\n",
      "feelings?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a meek shake of her head, ‘he\n",
      "certainly did so.  Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may\n",
      "be weaker on such points—more foolish if the term is preferred—than they\n",
      "might have been, if I had always occupied my present position.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse, as much as\n",
      "to say, ‘I am the proprietor of this female, and she’s worth your\n",
      "attention, I think.’  Then, resumed his discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to him when you saw\n",
      "him.  I didn’t mince the matter with him.  I am never mealy with ’em.  I\n",
      "KNOW ’em.  Very well, sir.  Three days after that, he bolted.  Went off,\n",
      "nobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy—only with this\n",
      "difference, that he is a worse subject than my mother, if possible.  What\n",
      "did he do before he went?  What do you say;’ Mr. Bounderby, with his hat\n",
      "in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his\n",
      "sentences, as if it were a tambourine; ‘to his being seen—night after\n",
      "night—watching the Bank?—to his lurking about there—after dark?—To its\n",
      "striking Mrs. Sparsit—that he could be lurking for no good—To her calling\n",
      "Bitzer’s attention to him, and their both taking notice of him—And to its\n",
      "appearing on inquiry to-day—that he was also noticed by the neighbours?’\n",
      "Having come to the climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put\n",
      "his tambourine on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Suspicious,’ said James Harthouse, ‘certainly.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think so, sir,’ said Bounderby, with a defiant nod.  ‘I think so.  But\n",
      "there are more of ’em in it.  There’s an old woman.  One never hears of\n",
      "these things till the mischief’s done; all sorts of defects are found out\n",
      "in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there’s an old woman turns\n",
      "up now.  An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a\n",
      "broomstick, every now and then.  _She_ watches the place a whole day\n",
      "before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals\n",
      "away with him and holds a council with him—I suppose, to make her report\n",
      "on going off duty, and be damned to her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "There was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from\n",
      "observation, thought Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is not all of ’em, even as we already know ’em,’ said Bounderby,\n",
      "with many nods of hidden meaning.  ‘But I have said enough for the\n",
      "present.  You’ll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no\n",
      "one.  It may take time, but we shall have ’em.  It’s policy to give ’em\n",
      "line enough, and there’s no objection to that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as\n",
      "notice-boards observe,’ replied James Harthouse, ‘and serve them right.\n",
      "Fellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences.  If there were no\n",
      "consequences, we should all go in for Banks.’  He had gently taken\n",
      "Louisa’s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked\n",
      "under its shade, though the sun did not shine there.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For the present, Loo Bounderby,’ said her husband, ‘here’s Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "to look after.  Mrs. Sparsit’s nerves have been acted upon by this\n",
      "business, and she’ll stay here a day or two.  So make her comfortable.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you very much, sir,’ that discreet lady observed, ‘but pray do not\n",
      "let My comfort be a consideration.  Anything will do for Me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her association\n",
      "with that domestic establishment, it was that she was so excessively\n",
      "regardless of herself and regardful of others, as to be a nuisance.  On\n",
      "being shown her chamber, she was so dreadfully sensible of its comforts\n",
      "as to suggest the inference that she would have preferred to pass the\n",
      "night on the mangle in the laundry.  True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses\n",
      "were accustomed to splendour, ‘but it is my duty to remember,’ Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace: particularly when any\n",
      "of the domestics were present, ‘that what I was, I am no longer.\n",
      "Indeed,’ said she, ‘if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr.\n",
      "Sparsit was a Powler, or that I myself am related to the Scadgers family;\n",
      "or if I could even revoke the fact, and make myself a person of common\n",
      "descent and ordinary connexions; I would gladly do so.  I should think\n",
      "it, under existing circumstances, right to do so.’  The same Hermitical\n",
      "state of mind led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner,\n",
      "until fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them; when she said,\n",
      "‘Indeed you are very good, sir;’ and departed from a resolution of which\n",
      "she had made rather formal and public announcement, to ‘wait for the\n",
      "simple mutton.’  She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt;\n",
      "and, feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest\n",
      "extent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves, occasionally sat back\n",
      "in her chair and silently wept; at which periods a tear of large\n",
      "dimensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed (or rather, must\n",
      "be, for it insisted on public notice) sliding down her Roman nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Sparsit’s greatest point, first and last, was her determination\n",
      "to pity Mr. Bounderby.  There were occasions when in looking at him she\n",
      "was involuntarily moved to shake her head, as who would say, ‘Alas, poor\n",
      "Yorick!’  After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of\n",
      "emotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully\n",
      "cheerful, and would say, ‘You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful\n",
      "to find;’ and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby bore up as he did.  One idiosyncrasy for which she often\n",
      "apologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer.  She had a\n",
      "curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ‘Miss Gradgrind,’ and yielded\n",
      "to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening.  Her\n",
      "repetition of this mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion;\n",
      "but indeed, she said, it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind:\n",
      "whereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the\n",
      "happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs.\n",
      "Bounderby, she found almost impossible.  It was a further singularity of\n",
      "this remarkable case, that the more she thought about it, the more\n",
      "impossible it appeared; ‘the differences,’ she observed, ‘being such.’\n",
      "\n",
      "In the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the\n",
      "robbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the\n",
      "suspected persons guilty, and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of\n",
      "the law.  That done, Bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to\n",
      "recommend Tom to come home by the mail-train.\n",
      "\n",
      "When candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured, ‘Don’t be low, sir.\n",
      "Pray let me see you cheerful, sir, as I used to do.’  Mr. Bounderby, upon\n",
      "whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him, in\n",
      "a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large\n",
      "sea-animal.  ‘I cannot bear to see you so, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Try\n",
      "a hand at backgammon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of\n",
      "living under your roof.’  ‘I haven’t played backgammon, ma’am,’ said Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby, ‘since that time.’  ‘No, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, soothingly,\n",
      "‘I am aware that you have not.  I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes no\n",
      "interest in the game.  But I shall be happy, sir, if you will\n",
      "condescend.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They played near a window, opening on the garden.  It was a fine night:\n",
      "not moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.  Louisa and Mr. Harthouse\n",
      "strolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the\n",
      "stillness, though not what they said.  Mrs. Sparsit, from her place at\n",
      "the backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the\n",
      "shadows without.  ‘What’s the matter, ma’am?’ said Mr. Bounderby; ‘you\n",
      "don’t see a Fire, do you?’  ‘Oh dear no, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I\n",
      "was thinking of the dew.’  ‘What have you got to do with the dew, ma’am?’\n",
      "said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘It’s not myself, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I am\n",
      "fearful of Miss Gradgrind’s taking cold.’  ‘She never takes cold,’ said\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Really, sir?’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  And was affected with\n",
      "a cough in her throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of\n",
      "water.  ‘Oh, sir?’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Not your sherry warm, with\n",
      "lemon-peel and nutmeg?’  ‘Why, I have got out of the habit of taking it\n",
      "now, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘The more’s the pity, sir,’ returned\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit; ‘you are losing all your good old habits.  Cheer up, sir!\n",
      "If Miss Gradgrind will permit me, I will offer to make it for you, as I\n",
      "have often done.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she\n",
      "pleased, that considerate lady made the beverage, and handed it to Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby.  ‘It will do you good, sir.  It will warm your heart.  It is\n",
      "the sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.’  And when Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby said, ‘Your health, ma’am!’ she answered with great feeling,\n",
      "‘Thank you, sir.  The same to you, and happiness also.’  Finally, she\n",
      "wished him good night, with great pathos; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed,\n",
      "with a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender,\n",
      "though he could not, for his life, have mentioned what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she watched and waited for\n",
      "her brother’s coming home.  That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour\n",
      "past midnight; but in the country silence, which did anything but calm\n",
      "the trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily.  At last, when the\n",
      "darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she\n",
      "heard the bell at the gate.  She felt as though she would have been glad\n",
      "that it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its\n",
      "last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air, and all was dead\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she judged.  Then she arose,\n",
      "put on a loose robe, and went out of her room in the dark, and up the\n",
      "staircase to her brother’s room.  His door being shut, she softly opened\n",
      "it and spoke to him, approaching his bed with a noiseless step.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kneeled down beside it, passed her arm over his neck, and drew his\n",
      "face to hers.  She knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said\n",
      "nothing to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that\n",
      "was, and what was the matter?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tom, have you anything to tell me?  If ever you loved me in your life,\n",
      "and have anything concealed from every one besides, tell it to me.’\n",

      "the earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house.  How she got\n",
      "from story to story was a mystery beyond solution.  A lady so decorous in\n",
      "herself, and so highly connected, was not to be suspected of dropping\n",
      "over the banisters or sliding down them, yet her extraordinary facility\n",
      "of locomotion suggested the wild idea.  Another noticeable circumstance\n",
      "in Mrs. Sparsit was, that she was never hurried.  She would shoot with\n",
      "consummate velocity from the roof to the hall, yet would be in full\n",
      "possession of her breath and dignity on the moment of her arrival there.\n",
      "Neither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse, and had some pleasant conversation\n",
      "with him soon after her arrival.  She made him her stately curtsey in the\n",
      "garden, one morning before breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It appears but yesterday, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘that I had the\n",
      "honour of receiving you at the Bank, when you were so good as to wish to\n",
      "be made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby’s address.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself in the course of\n",

      "most indolent of all possible airs.\n",

      "‘We live in a singular world, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.\n",

      "‘I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I am proud, to have\n",
      "made a remark, similar in effect, though not so epigrammatically\n",
      "expressed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A singular world, I would say, sir,’ pursued Mrs. Sparsit; after\n",
      "acknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows, not\n",
      "altogether so mild in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet\n",
      "tones; ‘as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with individuals\n",
      "we were quite ignorant of, at another.  I recall, sir, that on that\n",
      "occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss\n",
      "Gradgrind.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves.  I\n",
      "availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity, and it is\n",
      "unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate.  Mrs. Sparsit’s\n",
      "talent for—in fact for anything requiring accuracy—with a combination of\n",
      "strength of mind—and Family—is too habitually developed to admit of any\n",
      "question.’  He was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took\n",
      "him so long to get through, and his mind wandered so much in the course\n",
      "of its execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You found Miss Gradgrind—I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it’s\n",
      "very absurd of me—as youthful as I described her?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit,\n",
      "sweetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You drew her portrait perfectly,’ said Mr. Harthouse.  ‘Presented her\n",
      "dead image.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very engaging, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to\n",
      "revolve over one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Highly so.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It used to be considered,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘that Miss Gradgrind was\n",
      "wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and\n",
      "strikingly improved in that respect.  Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as\n",
      "if she had been talking and thinking of no one else.  ‘How do you find\n",
      "yourself this morning, sir?  Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his\n",
      "load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby\n",
      "softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most\n",
      "other people from his wife downward.  So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with\n",
      "forced lightness of heart, ‘You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say\n",
      "Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,’ Mr. Bounderby\n",
      "replied, ‘If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma’am, I believe\n",
      "you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I’ll trouble _you_\n",
      "to take charge of the teapot.’  Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her\n",
      "old position at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.  She was so\n",
      "humble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never\n",
      "could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often\n",
      "as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby’s breakfast, before\n",
      "Mrs. Gradgrind—she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby—she\n",
      "hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though\n",
      "she trusted to become familiar with it by and by—had assumed her present\n",
      "position.  It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to\n",
      "be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby’s time was so very precious, and she\n",
      "knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment,\n",
      "that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his\n",
      "will had been a law to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There!  Stop where you are, ma’am,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘stop where you\n",
      "are!  Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I\n",
      "believe.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t say that, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity,\n",
      "‘because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby.  And to be unkind is not\n",
      "to be you, sir.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You may set your mind at rest, ma’am.—You can take it very quietly,\n",
      "can’t you, Loo?’ said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course.  It is of no moment.  Why should it be of any importance to\n",
      "me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am?’\n",
      "said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight.  ‘You attach too\n",
      "much importance to these things, ma’am.  By George, you’ll be corrupted\n",
      "in some of your notions here.  You are old-fashioned, ma’am.  You are\n",
      "behind Tom Gradgrind’s children’s time.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is the matter with you?’ asked Louisa, coldly surprised.  ‘What has\n",
      "given you offence?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Offence!’ repeated Bounderby.  ‘Do you suppose if there was any offence\n",
      "given me, I shouldn’t name it, and request to have it corrected?  I am a\n",
      "straightforward man, I believe.  I don’t go beating about for\n",
      "side-winds.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident, or too\n",
      "delicate,’ Louisa answered him composedly: ‘I have never made that\n",
      "objection to you, either as a child or as a woman.  I don’t understand\n",
      "what you would have.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have?’ returned Mr. Bounderby.  ‘Nothing.  Otherwise, don’t you, Loo\n",
      "Bounderby, know thoroughly well that I, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown,\n",
      "would have it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with\n",
      "a proud colour in her face that was a new change, Mr. Harthouse thought.\n",
      "‘You are incomprehensible this morning,’ said Louisa.  ‘Pray take no\n",
      "further trouble to explain yourself.  I am not curious to know your\n",
      "meaning.  What does it matter?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing more was said on this theme, and Mr. Harthouse was soon idly gay\n",
      "on indifferent subjects.  But from this day, the Sparsit action upon Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together, and\n",
      "strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence\n",
      "against him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine\n",
      "that she could not retrace them if she tried.  But whether she ever tried\n",
      "or no, lay hidden in her own closed heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion, that,\n",
      "assisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after breakfast, and being then alone\n",
      "with him in the hall, she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand, murmured\n",
      "‘My benefactor!’ and retired, overwhelmed with grief.  Yet it is an\n",
      "indubitable fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five\n",
      "minutes after he had left the house in the self-same hat, the same\n",
      "descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers,\n",
      "shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a contemptuous grimace\n",

      "express from Stone Lodge.  It was a hasty note to inform Louisa that Mrs.\n",

      "knowledge; but, she had declined within the last few days, had continued\n",

      "was still hard at it in the national dust-yard.  Her mother had taken it\n",
      "rather as a disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she reclined\n",

      "‘I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You want to hear of me, my dear?  That’s something new, I am sure, when\n",
      "anybody wants to hear of me.  Not at all well, Louisa.  Very faint and\n",
      "giddy.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are you in pain, dear mother?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think there’s a pain somewhere in the room,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind, ‘but\n",
      "I couldn’t positively say that I have got it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "After this strange speech, she lay silent for some time.  Louisa, holding\n",
      "her hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin\n",
      "thread of life in fluttering motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You very seldom see your sister,’ said Mrs. Gradgrind.  ‘She grows like\n",
      "you.  I wish you would look at her.  Sissy, bring her here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She was brought, and stood with her hand in her sister’s.  Louisa had\n",
      "observed her with her arm round Sissy’s neck, and she felt the difference\n",
      "of this approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you see the likeness, Louisa?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, mother.  I should think her like me.  But—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Eh!  Yes, I always say so,’ Mrs. Gradgrind cried, with unexpected\n",
      "quickness.  ‘And that reminds me.  I—I want to speak to you, my dear.\n",
      "Sissy, my good girl, leave us alone a minute.’ Louisa had relinquished\n",
      "the hand: had thought that her sister’s was a better and brighter face\n",
      "than hers had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feeling of\n",
      "resentment, even in that place and at that time, something of the\n",
      "gentleness of the other face in the room; the sweet face with the\n",
      "trusting eyes, made paler than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich\n",
      "dark hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Left alone with her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon\n",
      "her face, like one who was floating away upon some great water, all\n",
      "resistance over, content to be carried down the stream.  She put the\n",
      "shadow of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You were going to speak to me, mother.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Eh?  Yes, to be sure, my dear.  You know your father is almost always\n",
      "away now, and therefore I must write to him about it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘About what, mother?  Don’t be troubled.  About what?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said anything, on any\n",
      "subject, I have never heard the last of it: and consequently, that I have\n",
      "long left off saying anything.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can hear you, mother.’  But, it was only by dint of bending down to\n",
      "her ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they\n",
      "moved, that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of\n",
      "connexion.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your brother.  Ologies of\n",
      "all kinds from morning to night.  If there is any Ology left, of any\n",
      "description, that has not been worn to rags in this house, all I can say\n",
      "is, I hope I shall never hear its name.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on.’  This, to keep\n",
      "her from floating away.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But there is something—not an Ology at all—that your father has missed,\n",
      "or forgotten, Louisa.  I don’t know what it is.  I have often sat with\n",
      "Sissy near me, and thought about it.  I shall never get its name now.\n",
      "But your father may.  It makes me restless.  I want to write to him, to\n",
      "find out for God’s sake, what it is.  Give me a pen, give me a pen.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the power of restlessness was gone, except from the poor head, which\n",
      "could just turn from side to side.\n",
      "\n",
      "She fancied, however, that her request had been complied with, and that\n",
      "the pen she could not have held was in her hand.  It matters little what\n",
      "figures of wonderful no-meaning she began to trace upon her wrappers.\n",
      "The hand soon stopped in the midst of them; the light that had always\n",
      "been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency, went out; and even Mrs.\n",
      "Gradgrind, emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth\n",
      "himself in vain, took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and\n",
      "patriarchs.\n",

      "MRS. SPARSIT’S STAIRCASE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MRS. SPARSIT’S nerves being slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman\n",
      "made a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby’s retreat, where,\n",
      "notwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming\n",
      "consciousness of her altered station, she resigned herself with noble\n",
      "fortitude to lodging, as one may say, in clover, and feeding on the fat\n",
      "of the land.  During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship\n",
      "of the Bank, Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency; continuing to\n",
      "take such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face, as is rarely taken on man,\n",
      "and to call his portrait a Noodle to _its_ face, with the greatest\n",
      "acrimony and contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general\n",
      "cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was),\n",
      "and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor\n",
      "if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything\n",
      "he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.  So\n",
      "when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming\n",
      "sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day\n",
      "before her departure, ‘I tell you what, ma’am; you shall come down here\n",
      "of a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.’  To\n",
      "which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan\n",
      "persuasion: ‘To hear is to obey.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the\n",
      "nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head.  Much watching of Louisa,\n",
      "and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which\n",
      "keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit’s edge, must have given her as\n",
      "it were a lift, in the way of inspiration.  She erected in her mind a\n",
      "mighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and\n",
      "down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa\n",
      "coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit’s life, to look up at her\n",
      "staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.  Sometimes slowly, sometimes\n",
      "quickly, sometimes several steps at one bout, sometimes stopping, never\n",
      "turning back.  If she had once turned back, it might have been the death\n",
      "of Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above.  Mrs. Sparsit was\n",
      "in good spirits, and inclined to be conversational.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And pray, sir,’ said she, ‘if I may venture to ask a question\n",
      "appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve—which is indeed\n",
      "hardy in me, for I well know you have a reason for everything you do—have\n",
      "you received intelligence respecting the robbery?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, ma’am, no; not yet.  Under the circumstances, I didn’t expect it\n",
      "yet.  Rome wasn’t built in a day, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very true, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nor yet in a week, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, indeed, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a gentle melancholy upon\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In a similar manner, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘I can wait, you know.  If\n",
      "Romulus and Remus could wait, Josiah Bounderby can wait.  They were\n",
      "better off in their youth than I was, however.  They had a she-wolf for a\n",
      "nurse; I had only a she-wolf for a grandmother.  She didn’t give any\n",
      "milk, ma’am; she gave bruises.  She was a regular Alderney at that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah!’ Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, ma’am,’ continued Bounderby, ‘I have not heard anything more about\n",
      "it.  It’s in hand, though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business\n",
      "at present—something new for him; he hadn’t the schooling _I_ had—is\n",
      "helping.  My injunction is, Keep it quiet, and let it seem to blow over.\n",
      "Do what you like under the rose, but don’t give a sign of what you’re\n",
      "about; or half a hundred of ’em will combine together and get this fellow\n",
      "who has bolted, out of reach for good.  Keep it quiet, and the thieves\n",
      "will grow in confidence by little and little, and we shall have ’em.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very sagacious indeed, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘Very interesting.  The\n",
      "old woman you mentioned, sir—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The old woman I mentioned, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, cutting the matter\n",
      "short, as it was nothing to boast about, ‘is not laid hold of; but, she\n",
      "may take her oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her\n",
      "villainous old mind.  In the mean time, ma’am, I am of opinion, if you\n",
      "ask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the better.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her chamber window, resting from her\n",
      "packing operations, looked towards her great staircase and saw Louisa\n",
      "still descending.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low;\n",
      "he stood leaning over her, as they whispered together, and his face\n",
      "almost touched her hair.  ‘If not quite!’ said Mrs. Sparsit, straining\n",
      "her hawk’s eyes to the utmost.  Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a\n",
      "word of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly,\n",
      "otherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said\n",
      "was this:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, perfectly!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘His face, and his manner, and what he said?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perfectly.  And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be.\n",
      "Lengthy and prosy in the extreme.  It was knowing to hold forth, in the\n",
      "humble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought at the\n",
      "time, “My good fellow, you are over-doing this!”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Louisa—as Tom says.’  Which he never did say.  ‘You know no good\n",
      "of the fellow?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, certainly.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nor of any other such person?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How can I,’ she returned, with more of her first manner on her than he\n",
      "had lately seen, ‘when I know nothing of them, men or women?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of\n",
      "your devoted friend, who knows something of several varieties of his\n",
      "excellent fellow-creatures—for excellent they are, I am quite ready to\n",
      "believe, in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to\n",
      "what they can get hold of.  This fellow talks.  Well; every fellow talks.\n",
      "He professes morality.  Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality.\n",
      "From the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general\n",
      "profession of morality, except among our people; it really is that\n",
      "exception which makes our people quite reviving.  You saw and heard the\n",
      "case.  Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my\n",
      "esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby—who, as we know, is not possessed of that\n",
      "delicacy which would soften so tight a hand.  The member of the fluffy\n",
      "classes was injured, exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody\n",
      "who proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business, went\n",
      "in, put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and\n",
      "relieved his mind extremely.  Really he would have been an uncommon,\n",
      "instead of a common, fellow, if he had not availed himself of such an\n",
      "opportunity.  Or he may have originated it altogether, if he had the\n",
      "cleverness.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,’ returned Louisa, after\n",
      "sitting thoughtful awhile, ‘to be so ready to agree with you, and to be\n",
      "so lightened in my heart by what you say.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse.  I have talked it over\n",
      "with my friend Tom more than once—of course I remain on terms of perfect\n",
      "confidence with Tom—and he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his.\n",
      "Will you walk?’\n",
      "\n",
      "They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the\n",
      "twilight—she leaning on his arm—and she little thought how she was going\n",
      "down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit’s staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing.  When Louisa had arrived at\n",
      "the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it\n",
      "would; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit’s eyes.  And there Louisa always was, upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And always gliding down, down, down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and\n",
      "there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked\n",
      "to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept\n",
      "her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of\n",
      "compunction, all absorbed in interest.  In the interest of seeing her,\n",
      "ever drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom\n",
      "of this new Giant’s Staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his\n",
      "portrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the\n",
      "descent.  Eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for\n",
      "the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her\n",
      "hopes.  Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and\n",
      "seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at\n",
      "the figure coming down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XI\n",
      "LOWER AND LOWER\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always\n",
      "verging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife’s decease, made an expedition from\n",
      "London, and buried her in a business-like manner.  He then returned with\n",
      "promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the\n",
      "odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes\n",
      "of other people who wanted other odds and ends—in fact resumed his\n",
      "parliamentary duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  Separated\n",
      "from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing\n",
      "Coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like\n",
      "observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through\n",
      "James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through\n",
      "everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.\n",
      "‘Your foot on the last step, my lady,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing\n",
      "the descending figure, with the aid of her threatening mitten, ‘and all\n",
      "your art shall never blind me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Art or nature though, the original stock of Louisa’s character or the\n",
      "graft of circumstances upon it,—her curious reserve did baffle, while it\n",
      "stimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit.  There were times when Mr.\n",
      "James Harthouse was not sure of her.  There were times when he could not\n",
      "read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a\n",
      "greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of\n",
      "satellites to help her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away\n",
      "from home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or\n",
      "four days.  It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at\n",
      "the Bank, adding: ‘But you’ll go down to-morrow, ma’am, all the same.\n",
      "You’ll go down just as if I was there.  It will make no difference to\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pray, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, ‘let me beg you not to\n",
      "say that.  Your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I\n",
      "think you very well know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,’\n",
      "said Mr. Bounderby, not displeased.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Bounderby,’ retorted Mrs. Sparsit, ‘your will is to me a law, sir;\n",
      "otherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not\n",
      "feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to\n",
      "receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.  But you\n",
      "shall say no more, sir.  I will go, upon your invitation.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, when I invite you to my house, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, opening his\n",
      "eyes, ‘I should hope you want no other invitation.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, indeed, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘I should hope not.  Say no\n",
      "more, sir.  I would, sir, I could see you gay again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you mean, ma’am?’ blustered Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, ‘there was wont to be an elasticity in you\n",
      "which I sadly miss.  Be buoyant, sir!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed\n",
      "up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and\n",
      "ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being\n",
      "heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bitzer,’ said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on\n",
      "his journey, and the Bank was closing, ‘present my compliments to young\n",
      "Mr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop\n",
      "and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?’  Young Mr. Thomas being\n",
      "usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and\n",
      "followed on its heels.  ‘Mr. Thomas,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘these plain\n",
      "viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank’ee, Mrs. Sparsit,’ said the whelp.  And gloomily fell to.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, he’s all right,’ said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where may he be at present?’ Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light\n",
      "conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies\n",
      "for being so uncommunicative.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He is shooting in Yorkshire,’ said Tom.  ‘Sent Loo a basket half as big\n",
      "as a church, yesterday.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The kind of gentleman, now,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, ‘whom one might\n",
      "wager to be a good shot!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Crack,’ said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had\n",
      "so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three\n",
      "seconds together.  Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching\n",
      "his looks, if she were so inclined.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘as\n",
      "indeed he is of most people.  May we expect to see him again shortly, Mr.\n",
      "Tom?’\n",

      "if he was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that way.’\n",
      "\n",

      "reasons for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a\n",
      "passenger would arrive from Yorkshire, and for preferring to peep into it\n",
      "round pillars and corners, and out of ladies’ waiting-room windows, to\n",
      "appearing in its precincts openly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was in attendance, and loitered about until the expected train came\n",
      "in.  It brought no Mr. Harthouse.  Tom waited until the crowd had\n",
      "dispersed, and the bustle was over; and then referred to a posted list of\n",
      "trains, and took counsel with porters.  That done, he strolled away idly,\n",
      "stopping in the street and looking up it and down it, and lifting his hat\n",
      "off and putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and\n",
      "exhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who\n",
      "had still to wait until the next train should come in, an hour and forty\n",
      "minutes hence.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It was the conception of an inspired moment, and she shot off with her\n",
      "utmost swiftness to work it out.  The station for the country house was\n",
      "at the opposite end of the town, the time was short, the road not easy;\n",
      "but she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach, so quick in\n",
      "darting out of it, producing her money, seizing her ticket, and diving\n",
      "into the train, that she was borne along the arches spanning the land of\n",
      "coal-pits past and present, as if she had been caught up in a cloud and\n",
      "whirled away.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the journey, immovable in the air though never left behind; plain to\n",
      "the dark eyes of her mind, as the electric wires which ruled a colossal\n",
      "strip of music-paper out of the evening sky, were plain to the dark eyes\n",
      "of her body; Mrs. Sparsit saw her staircase, with the figure coming down.\n",

      "\n",
      "An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its\n",

      "wooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a\n",
      "green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches.\n",
      "One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily\n",
      "crossing and recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick\n",

      "very softly closed a gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round\n",
      "it, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows.  Most of them were\n",
      "open, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights\n",
      "yet, and all was silent.  She tried the garden with no better effect.\n",
      "She thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and\n",
      "briers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the creeping things that be.\n",
      "With her dark eyes and her hook nose warily in advance of her, Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit softly crushed her way through the thick undergrowth, so intent\n",
      "upon her object that she probably would have done no less, if the wood\n",

      "listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low voices close at hand.  His voice and hers.  The appointment _was_ a\n",
      "device to keep the brother away!  There they were yonder, by the felled\n",
      "tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bending low among the dewy grass, Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer to them.\n",
      "She drew herself up, and stood behind a tree, like Robinson Crusoe in his\n",
      "ambuscade against the savages; so near to them that at a spring, and that\n",
      "no great one, she could have touched them both.  He was there secretly,\n",
      "and had not shown himself at the house.  He had come on horseback, and\n",
      "must have passed through the neighbouring fields; for his horse was tied\n",
      "to the meadow side of the fence, within a few paces.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dearest love,’ said he, ‘what could I do?  Knowing you were alone,\n",

      "\n",
      "That she hung her head, was certain.  She urged him to go away, she\n",
      "commanded him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor\n",
      "raised it.  Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the\n",
      "amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life.\n",
      "Her hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her\n",
      "manner of speaking was not hurried.\n",
      "\n",

      "had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of\n",
      "which he had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her\n",
      "confidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.  All this, and more,\n",

      "rain among the leaves, and a thunderstorm rolling up—Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "received into her mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of\n",
      "confusion and indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the fence\n",
      "and led his horse away, she was not sure where they were to meet, or\n",
      "when, except that they had said it was to be that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and while she\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her enter the house.  What\n",
      "to do next?  It rained now, in a sheet of water.  Mrs. Sparsit’s white\n",
      "stockings were of many colours, green predominating; prickly things were\n",
      "in her shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own\n",
      "making, from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and\n",
      "her Roman nose.  In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the\n",
      "density of the shrubbery, considering what next?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lo, Louisa coming out of the house!  Hastily cloaked and muffled, and\n",
      "stealing away.  She elopes!  She falls from the lowermost stair, and is\n",
      "swallowed up in the gulf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she\n",
      "struck into a side-path parallel with the ride.  Mrs. Sparsit followed in\n",
      "the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to\n",
      "keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "stopped.  When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on.  She went by the way\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony\n",
      "road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad.  A train for\n",
      "Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she\n",

      "\n",
      "In Mrs. Sparsit’s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were\n",
      "necessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee\n",
      "of the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on\n",
      "over her bonnet.  So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when\n",
      "she followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small\n",
      "office.  Louisa sat waiting in a corner.  Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in\n",
      "another corner.  Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the\n",
      "rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the\n",
      "arches.  Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw\n",
      "the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron\n",
      "tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening\n",
      "to a complaint of the heart, announced the train.  Fire and steam, and\n",
      "smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put\n",
      "into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station a\n",
      "desert speck in the thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold, Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "exulted hugely.  The figure had plunged down the precipice, and she felt\n",
      "herself, as it were, attending on the body.  Could she, who had been so\n",
      "active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?\n",
      "‘She will be at Coketown long before him,’ thought Mrs. Sparsit, ‘though\n",
      "his horse is never so good.  Where will she wait for him?  And where will\n",
      "they go together?  Patience.  We shall see.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion, when the train stopped\n",
      "at its destination.  Gutters and pipes had burst, drains had overflowed,\n",
      "and streets were under water.  In the first instant of alighting, Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which\n",
      "were in great request.  ‘She will get into one,’ she considered, ‘and\n",
      "will be away before I can follow in another.  At all risks of being run\n",
      "over, I must see the number, and hear the order given to the coachman.’\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation.  Louisa got into no\n",
      "coach, and was already gone.  The black eyes kept upon the\n",
      "railroad-carriage in which she had travelled, settled upon it a moment\n",
      "too late.  The door not being opened after several minutes, Mrs. Sparsit\n",
      "passed it and repassed it, saw nothing, looked in, and found it empty.\n",
      "Wet through and through: with her feet squelching and squashing in her\n",
      "shoes whenever she moved; with a rash of rain upon her classical visage;\n",
      "with a bonnet like an over-ripe fig; with all her clothes spoiled; with\n",
      "damp impressions of every button, string, and hook-and-eye she wore,\n",
      "printed off upon her highly connected back; with a stagnant verdure on\n",
      "her general exterior, such as accumulates on an old park fence in a\n",

      "proposed my husband to me.  I took him.  I never made a pretence to him\n",
      "or you that I loved him.  I knew, and, father, you knew, and he knew,\n",
      "that I never did.  I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of\n",
      "being pleasant and useful to Tom.  I made that wild escape into something\n",
      "visionary, and have slowly found out how wild it was.  But Tom had been\n",
      "the subject of all the little tenderness of my life; perhaps he became so\n",

      "LOUISA awoke from a torpor, and her eyes languidly opened on her old bed\n",
      "at home, and her old room.  It seemed, at first, as if all that had\n",
      "happened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the\n",
      "shadows of a dream, but gradually, as the objects became more real to her\n",
      "sight, the events became more real to her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her eyes were\n",
      "strained and sore, and she was very weak.  A curious passive inattention\n",
      "had such possession of her, that the presence of her little sister in the\n",
      "room did not attract her notice for some time.  Even when their eyes had\n",
      "met, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes\n",
      "looking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive\n",
      "hand, before she asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When was I brought to this room?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Last night, Louisa.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who brought me here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sissy, I believe.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why do you believe so?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Because I found her here this morning.  She didn’t come to my bedside to\n",
      "wake me, as she always does; and I went to look for her.  She was not in\n",
      "her own room either; and I went looking for her all over the house, until\n",
      "I found her here taking care of you and cooling your head.  Will you see\n",
      "father? Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a beaming face you have, Jane!’ said Louisa, as her young\n",
      "sister—timidly still—bent down to kiss her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have I?  I am very glad you think so.  I am sure it must be Sissy’s\n",
      "doing.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent itself.  ‘You\n",
      "can tell father if you will.’  Then, staying her for a moment, she said,\n",
      "‘It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of\n",
      "welcome?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came.  It was—’\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more.  When her sister had\n",
      "withdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay with her face towards\n",
      "the door, until it opened and her father entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually steady,\n",
      "trembled in hers.  He sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking\n",
      "how she was, and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet\n",
      "after her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.  He spoke in\n",
      "a subdued and troubled voice, very different from his usual dictatorial\n",
      "manner; and was often at a loss for words.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Louisa.  My poor daughter.’  He was so much at a loss at that\n",
      "place, that he stopped altogether.  He tried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My unfortunate child.’  The place was so difficult to get over, that he\n",
      "tried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour to tell you how\n",
      "overwhelmed I have been, and still am, by what broke upon me last night.\n",
      "The ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet.  The\n",
      "only support on which I leaned, and the strength of which it seemed, and\n",
      "still does seem, impossible to question, has given way in an instant.  I\n",
      "am stunned by these discoveries.  I have no selfish meaning in what I\n",
      "say; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last night, to be very\n",
      "heavy indeed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She could give him no comfort herein.  She had suffered the wreck of her\n",
      "whole life upon the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will not say, Louisa, that if you had by any happy chance undeceived\n",
      "me some time ago, it would have been better for us both; better for your\n",
      "peace, and better for mine.  For I am sensible that it may not have been\n",
      "a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind.  I had proved\n",
      "my—my system to myself, and I have rigidly administered it; and I must\n",
      "bear the responsibility of its failures.  I only entreat you to believe,\n",
      "my favourite child, that I have meant to do right.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it earnestly, and to do him justice he had.  In gauging\n",
      "fathomless deeps with his little mean excise-rod, and in staggering over\n",
      "the universe with his rusty stiff-legged compasses, he had meant to do\n",
      "great things.  Within the limits of his short tether he had tumbled\n",
      "about, annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of\n",
      "purpose than many of the blatant personages whose company he kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am well assured of what you say, father.  I know I have been your\n",
      "favourite child.  I know you have intended to make me happy.  I have\n",
      "never blamed you, and I never shall.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her outstretched hand, and retained it in his.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear, I have remained all night at my table, pondering again and\n",
      "again on what has so painfully passed between us.  When I consider your\n",
      "character; when I consider that what has been known to me for hours, has\n",
      "been concealed by you for years; when I consider under what immediate\n",
      "pressure it has been forced from you at last; I come to the conclusion\n",
      "that I cannot but mistrust myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He might have added more than all, when he saw the face now looking at\n",
      "him.  He did add it in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her scattered\n",
      "hair from her forehead with his hand.  Such little actions, slight in\n",
      "another man, were very noticeable in him; and his daughter received them\n",
      "as if they had been words of contrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, slowly, and with hesitation, as well as with a\n",
      "wretched sense of happiness, ‘if I see reason to mistrust myself for the\n",
      "past, Louisa, I should also mistrust myself for the present and the\n",
      "future.  To speak unreservedly to you, I do.  I am far from feeling\n",
      "convinced now, however differently I might have felt only this time\n",
      "yesterday, that I am fit for the trust you repose in me; that I know how\n",
      "to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me; that I have\n",
      "the right instinct—supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that\n",
      "nature—how to help you, and to set you right, my child.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face upon her arm, so\n",
      "that he could not see it.  All her wildness and passion had subsided;\n",
      "but, though softened, she was not in tears.  Her father was changed in\n",
      "nothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to see her\n",
      "in tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Some persons hold,’ he pursued, still hesitating, ‘that there is a\n",
      "wisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart.  I have not\n",
      "supposed so; but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now.  I have supposed\n",
      "the head to be all-sufficient.  It may not be all-sufficient; how can I\n",
      "venture this morning to say it is!  If that other kind of wisdom should\n",
      "be what I have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted,\n",
      "Louisa—’\n",
      "\n",
      "He suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling to admit it\n",
      "even now.  She made him no answer, lying before him on her bed, still\n",
      "half-dressed, much as he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Louisa,’ and his hand rested on her hair again, ‘I have been absent from\n",
      "here, my dear, a good deal of late; and though your sister’s training has\n",
      "been pursued according to—the system,’ he appeared to come to that word\n",
      "with great reluctance always, ‘it has necessarily been modified by daily\n",
      "associations begun, in her case, at an early age.  I ask you—ignorantly\n",
      "and humbly, my daughter—for the better, do you think?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Father,’ she replied, without stirring, ‘if any harmony has been\n",
      "awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to\n",
      "discord, let her thank Heaven for it, and go upon her happier way, taking\n",
      "it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O my child, my child!’ he said, in a forlorn manner, ‘I am an unhappy\n",
      "man to see you thus!  What avails it to me that you do not reproach me,\n",
      "if I so bitterly reproach myself!’  He bent his head, and spoke low to\n",
      "her.  ‘Louisa, I have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly\n",
      "working about me in this house, by mere love and gratitude: that what the\n",
      "Head had left undone and could not do, the Heart may have been doing\n",
      "silently.  Can it be so?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She made him no reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am not too proud to believe it, Louisa.  How could I be arrogant, and\n",
      "you before me!  Can it be so?  Is it so, my dear?’  He looked upon her\n",
      "once more, lying cast away there; and without another word went out of\n",
      "the room.  He had not been long gone, when she heard a light tread near\n",
      "the door, and knew that some one stood beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not raise her head.  A dull anger that she should be seen in her\n",
      "distress, and that the involuntary look she had so resented should come\n",
      "to this fulfilment, smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire.  All\n",
      "closely imprisoned forces rend and destroy.  The air that would be\n",
      "healthful to the earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that\n",
      "would ripen it, tear it when caged up.  So in her bosom even now; the\n",
      "strongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon themselves, became a\n",
      "heap of obduracy, that rose against a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and that she understood\n",
      "herself to be supposed to have fallen asleep.  The sympathetic hand did\n",
      "not claim her resentment.  Let it lie there, let it lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "It lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she\n",
      "rested.  As she softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being\n",
      "so watched, some tears made their way into her eyes.  The face touched\n",
      "hers, and she knew that there were tears upon it too, and she the cause\n",
      "of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired, so that\n",
      "she stood placidly near the bedside.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope I have not disturbed you.  I have come to ask if you would let me\n",
      "stay with you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why should you stay with me?  My sister will miss you.  You are\n",
      "everything to her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Am I?’ returned Sissy, shaking her head.  ‘I would be something to you,\n",
      "if I might.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What?’ said Louisa, almost sternly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Whatever you want most, if I could be that.  At all events, I would like\n",
      "to try to be as near it as I can.  And however far off that may be, I\n",
      "will never tire of trying.  Will you let me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My father sent you to ask me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No indeed,’ replied Sissy.  ‘He told me that I might come in now, but he\n",
      "sent me away from the room this morning—or at least—’\n",
      "\n",
      "She hesitated and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘At least, what?’ said Louisa, with her searching eyes upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought it best myself that I should be sent away, for I felt very\n",
      "uncertain whether you would like to find me here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have I always hated you so much?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have always wished that you\n",
      "should know it.  But you changed to me a little, shortly before you left\n",
      "home.  Not that I wondered at it.  You knew so much, and I knew so\n",
      "little, and it was so natural in many ways, going as you were among other\n",
      "friends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly.  Louisa understood\n",
      "the loving pretence, and her heart smote her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘May I try?’ said Sissy, emboldened to raise her hand to the neck that\n",
      "was insensibly drooping towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa, taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another\n",
      "moment, held it in one of hers, and answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘First, Sissy, do you know what I am?  I am so proud and so hardened, so\n",
      "confused and troubled, so resentful and unjust to every one and to\n",
      "myself, that everything is stormy, dark, and wicked to me.  Does not that\n",
      "repel you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am so unhappy, and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid\n",
      "waste, that if I had been bereft of sense to this hour, and instead of\n",
      "being as learned as you think me, had to begin to acquire the simplest\n",
      "truths, I could not want a guide to peace, contentment, honour, all the\n",
      "good of which I am quite devoid, more abjectly than I do.  Does not that\n",
      "repel you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’\n",
      "\n",
      "In the innocence of her brave affection, and the brimming up of her old\n",
      "devoted spirit, the once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon\n",
      "the darkness of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow\n",
      "there.  She fell upon her knees, and clinging to this stroller’s child\n",
      "looked up at her almost with veneration.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Forgive me, pity me, help me!  Have compassion on my great need, and let\n",
      "me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart!’\n",

      "have recognized him during that insane interval, as the brother Jem of\n",

      "several times spoke with an emphasis, similar to the vulgar manner.  He\n",

      "‘Well!  I don’t know,’ said Tom, who had his own reasons for being uneasy\n",

      "Cursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he was so true\n",
      "a friend, Mr. Harthouse disembarrassed himself of that interview with the\n",
      "smallest conceivable amount of ceremony, and debated for the hundredth\n",
      "time what all this could mean?  He made only one thing clear.  It was,\n",
      "that whether she was in town or out of town, whether he had been\n",
      "premature with her who was so hard to comprehend, or she had lost\n",
      "courage, or they were discovered, or some mischance or mistake, at\n",
      "present incomprehensible, had occurred, he must remain to confront his\n",
      "fortune, whatever it was.  The hotel where he was known to live when\n",
      "condemned to that region of blackness, was the stake to which he was\n",
      "tied.  As to all the rest—What will be, will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So, whether I am waiting for a hostile message, or an assignation, or a\n",
      "penitent remonstrance, or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby\n",
      "in the Lancashire manner—which would seem as likely as anything else in\n",
      "the present state of affairs—I’ll dine,’ said Mr. James Harthouse.\n",
      "‘Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight; and if anything of a\n",
      "British nature is to come off between us, it may be as well to be in\n",
      "training.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore he rang the bell, and tossing himself negligently on a sofa,\n",
      "ordered ‘Some dinner at six—with a beefsteak in it,’ and got through the\n",
      "intervening time as well as he could.  That was not particularly well;\n",
      "for he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on,\n",
      "and no kind of explanation offered itself, his perplexity augmented at\n",
      "compound interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do, and\n",
      "entertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than\n",
      "once.  ‘It wouldn’t be bad,’ he yawned at one time, ‘to give the waiter\n",
      "five shillings, and throw him.’  At another time it occurred to him, ‘Or\n",
      "a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone might be hired by the hour.’\n",
      "But these jests did not tell materially on the afternoon, or his\n",
      "suspense; and, sooth to say, they both lagged fearfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often walking about in\n",
      "the pattern of the carpet, looking out of the window, listening at the\n",
      "door for footsteps, and occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps\n",
      "approached that room.  But, after dinner, when the day turned to\n",
      "twilight, and the twilight turned to night, and still no communication\n",
      "was made to him, it began to be as he expressed it, ‘like the Holy Office\n",
      "and slow torture.’  However, still true to his conviction that\n",
      "indifference was the genuine high-breeding (the only conviction he had),\n",
      "he seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a\n",
      "newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read this newspaper,\n",
      "when the waiter appeared and said, at once mysteriously and\n",
      "apologetically:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Beg your pardon, sir.  You’re wanted, sir, if you please.’\n",
      "\n",
      "A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to\n",
      "the swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return, with\n",
      "bristling indignation, what the Devil he meant by ‘wanted’?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Beg your pardon, sir.  Young lady outside, sir, wishes to see you.’\n",

      "Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a block-head duly\n",
      "qualified for that consignment, Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery.\n",
      "A young woman whom he had never seen stood there.  Plainly dressed, very\n",
      "quiet, very pretty.  As he conducted her into the room and placed a chair\n",
      "for her, he observed, by the light of the candles, that she was even\n",
      "prettier than he had at first believed.  Her face was innocent and\n",
      "youthful, and its expression remarkably pleasant.  She was not afraid of\n",
      "him, or in any way disconcerted; she seemed to have her mind entirely\n",
      "preoccupied with the occasion of her visit, and to have substituted that\n",
      "consideration for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I speak to Mr. Harthouse?’ she said, when they were alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To Mr. Harthouse.’  He added in his mind, ‘And you speak to him with the\n",
      "most confiding eyes I ever saw, and the most earnest voice (though so\n",
      "quiet) I ever heard.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If I do not understand—and I do not, sir’—said Sissy, ‘what your honour\n",
      "as a gentleman binds you to, in other matters:’ the blood really rose in\n",
      "his face as she began in these words: ‘I am sure I may rely upon it to\n",
      "keep my visit secret, and to keep secret what I am going to say.  I will\n",
      "rely upon it, if you will tell me I may so far trust—’\n",

      "\n",
      "‘She hurried there last night.  She arrived there in great agitation, and\n",

      "question that he was so circumstanced.  The child-like ingenuousness with\n",
      "which his visitor spoke, her modest fearlessness, her truthfulness which\n",
      "put all artifice aside, her entire forgetfulness of herself in her\n",
      "earnest quiet holding to the object with which she had come; all this,\n",
      "together with her reliance on his easily given promise—which in itself\n",
      "shamed him—presented something in which he was so inexperienced, and\n",
      "against which he knew any of his usual weapons would fall so powerless;\n",
      "that not a word could he rally to his relief.\n",

      "He bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration.\n",
      "\n",

      "compromising her in any way, or in committing myself by any expression of\n",

      "smoothness so perfectly diabolical, that I had not the slightest idea the\n",
      "catalogue was half so long until I began to turn it over.  Whereas I\n",

      "\n",
      "Though he said all this in his frivolous way, the way seemed, for that\n",
      "once, a conscious polishing of but an ugly surface.  He was silent for a\n",

      "\n",

      "confidence you have mentioned has been reposed, that I cannot refuse to\n",
      "contemplate the possibility (however unexpected) of my seeing the lady no\n",
      "more.  I am solely to blame for the thing having come to this—and—and, I\n",
      "cannot say,’ he added, rather hard up for a general peroration, ‘that I\n",
      "have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow, or\n",
      "that I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sissy’s face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him was not finished.\n",

      "disadvantage, ‘the only reparation that remains with you, is to leave\n",
      "here immediately and finally.  I am quite sure that you can mitigate in\n",
      "no other way the wrong and harm you have done.  I am quite sure that it\n",
      "is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make.  I do\n",
      "not say that it is much, or that it is enough; but it is something, and\n",
      "it is necessary.  Therefore, though without any other authority than I\n",
      "have given you, and even without the knowledge of any other person than\n",
      "yourself and myself, I ask you to depart from this place to-night, under\n",
      "an obligation never to return to it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "If she had asserted any influence over him beyond her plain faith in the\n",
      "truth and right of what she said; if she had concealed the least doubt or\n",
      "irresolution, or had harboured for the best purpose any reserve or\n",
      "pretence; if she had shown, or felt, the lightest trace of any\n",
      "sensitiveness to his ridicule or his astonishment, or any remonstrance he\n",
      "might offer; he would have carried it against her at this point.  But he\n",
      "could as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise, as\n",
      "affect her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But do you know,’ he asked, quite at a loss, ‘the extent of what you\n",
      "ask?  You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of\n",
      "business, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for,\n",
      "and sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate\n",
      "manner?  You probably are not aware of that, but I assure you it’s the\n",
      "fact.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It had no effect on Sissy, fact or no fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Besides which,’ said Mr. Harthouse, taking a turn or two across the\n",
      "room, dubiously, ‘it’s so alarmingly absurd.  It would make a man so\n",
      "ridiculous, after going in for these fellows, to back out in such an\n",
      "incomprehensible way.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am quite sure,’ repeated Sissy, ‘that it is the only reparation in\n",
      "your power, sir.  I am quite sure, or I would not have come here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced at her face, and walked about again.  ‘Upon my soul, I don’t\n",
      "know what to say.  So immensely absurd!’\n",
      "\n",
      "It fell to his lot, now, to stipulate for secrecy.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing,’ he said, stopping again\n",
      "presently, and leaning against the chimney-piece, ‘it could only be in\n",
      "the most inviolable confidence.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will trust to you, sir,’ returned Sissy, ‘and you will trust to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "His leaning against the chimney-piece reminded him of the night with the\n",
      "whelp.  It was the self-same chimney-piece, and somehow he felt as if\n",
      "_he_ were the whelp to-night.  He could make no way at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position,’ he\n",
      "said, after looking down, and looking up, and laughing, and frowning, and\n",
      "walking off, and walking back again.  ‘But I see no way out of it.  What\n",
      "will be, will be.  _This_ will be, I suppose.  I must take off myself, I\n",
      "imagine—in short, I engage to do it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sissy rose.  She was not surprised by the result, but she was happy in\n",
      "it, and her face beamed brightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You will permit me to say,’ continued Mr. James Harthouse, ‘that I doubt\n",
      "if any other ambassador, or ambassadress, could have addressed me with\n",
      "the same success.  I must not only regard myself as being in a very\n",
      "ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points.  Will you\n",
      "allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy’s name?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_My_ name?’ said the ambassadress.\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Pardon my curiosity at parting.  Related to the family?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am only a poor girl,’ returned Sissy.  ‘I was separated from my\n",

      "lived in the house ever since.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It wanted this to complete the defeat,’ said Mr. James Harthouse,\n",
      "sinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a\n",
      "little while.  ‘The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished.\n",
      "Only a poor girl—only a stroller—only James Harthouse made nothing\n",
      "of—only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the Nile.  He took a pen\n",
      "upon the instant, and wrote the following note (in appropriate\n",

      "\n",
      "    Dear Jack,—All up at Coketown.  Bored out of the place, and going in\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Tell him to get up, and pack up.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote two more notes.  One, to Mr. Bounderby, announcing his\n",
      "retirement from that part of the country, and showing where he would be\n",
      "found for the next fortnight.  The other, similar in effect, to Mr.\n",
      "Gradgrind.  Almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions,\n",

      "himself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad business.  But it\n",
      "was not so, at all.  A secret sense of having failed and been\n",
      "ridiculous—a dread of what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of\n",

      "made him ashamed of himself.\n",

      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "VERY DECIDED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE indefatigable Mrs. Sparsit, with a violent cold upon her, her voice\n",
      "reduced to a whisper, and her stately frame so racked by continual\n",
      "sneezes that it seemed in danger of dismemberment, gave chase to her\n",
      "patron until she found him in the metropolis; and there, majestically\n",
      "sweeping in upon him at his hotel in St. James’s Street, exploded the\n",
      "combustibles with which she was charged, and blew up.  Having executed\n",
      "her mission with infinite relish, this high-minded woman then fainted\n",
      "away on Mr. Bounderby’s coat-collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby’s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave\n",
      "her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the\n",
      "floor.  He next had recourse to the administration of potent\n",
      "restoratives, such as screwing the patient’s thumbs, smiting her hands,\n",
      "abundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her mouth.  When\n",
      "these attentions had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled\n",
      "her into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried\n",
      "her back to Coketown more dead than alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle\n",
      "on her arrival at her journey’s end; but considered in any other light,\n",
      "the amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and\n",
      "impaired her claims to admiration.  Utterly heedless of the wear and tear\n",
      "of her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to Stone\n",
      "Lodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law’s\n",
      "room late at night; ‘here’s a lady here—Mrs. Sparsit—you know Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit—who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You have missed my letter!’ exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the\n",
      "apparition.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Missed your letter, sir!’ bawled Bounderby.  ‘The present time is no\n",
      "time for letters.  No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\n",
      "about letters, with his mind in the state it’s in now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, ‘I\n",
      "speak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to\n",
      "Louisa.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tom Gradgrind,’ replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several\n",
      "times with great vehemence on the table, ‘I speak of a very special\n",
      "messenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa.  Mrs. Sparsit,\n",
      "ma’am, stand forward!’\n",
      "\n",
      "That unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony, without any\n",
      "voice and with painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat, became\n",
      "so aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions, that Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and shook her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you can’t get it out, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘leave _me_ to get it\n",
      "out.  This is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be\n",
      "totally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.  Tom Gradgrind, Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation to overhear a\n",
      "conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious\n",
      "gentleman-friend, Mr. James Harthouse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Indeed!’ said Mr. Gradgrind.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah!  Indeed!’ cried Bounderby.  ‘And in that conversation—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is not necessary to repeat its tenor, Bounderby.  I know what\n",
      "passed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You do?  Perhaps,’ said Bounderby, staring with all his might at his so\n",
      "quiet and assuasive father-in-law, ‘you know where your daughter is at\n",
      "the present time!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Undoubtedly.  She is here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks, on\n",
      "all accounts.  Louisa is here.  The moment she could detach herself from\n",
      "that interview with the person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply\n",
      "regret to have been the means of introducing to you, Louisa hurried here,\n",
      "for protection.  I myself had not been at home many hours, when I\n",
      "received her—here, in this room.  She hurried by the train to town, she\n",
      "ran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented\n",
      "herself before me in a state of distraction.  Of course, she has remained\n",
      "here ever since.  Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to\n",
      "be more quiet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in every\n",
      "direction except Mrs. Sparsit’s direction; and then, abruptly turning\n",
      "upon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that wretched woman:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, ma’am!  We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think\n",
      "proper to offer, for going about the country at express pace, with no\n",
      "other luggage than a Cock-and-a-Bull, ma’am!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ whispered Mrs. Sparsit, ‘my nerves are at present too much shaken,\n",
      "and my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit\n",
      "of my doing more than taking refuge in tears.’  (Which she did.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘without making any observation to you\n",
      "that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family, what I\n",
      "have got to add to that, is that there is something else in which it\n",
      "appears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.  And the coach in\n",
      "which we came here being at the door, you’ll allow me to hand you down to\n",
      "it, and pack you home to the Bank: where the best course for you to\n",
      "pursue, will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear, and\n",
      "take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed.’  With\n",
      "these words, Mr. Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady,\n",
      "and escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive\n",
      "sneezes by the way.  He soon returned alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that you wanted to\n",
      "speak to me,’ he resumed, ‘here I am.  But, I am not in a very agreeable\n",
      "state, I tell you plainly: not relishing this business, even as it is,\n",
      "and not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively\n",
      "treated by your daughter, as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be\n",
      "treated by his wife.  You have your opinion, I dare say; and I have mine,\n",
      "I know.  If you mean to say anything to me to-night, that goes against\n",
      "this candid remark, you had better let it alone.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, Mr. Bounderby\n",
      "took particular pains to harden himself at all points.  It was his\n",
      "amiable nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Bounderby,’ Mr. Gradgrind began in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, you’ll excuse me,’ said Bounderby, ‘but I don’t want to be too\n",
      "dear.  That, to start with.  When I begin to be dear to a man, I\n",
      "generally find that his intention is to come over me.  I am not speaking\n",
      "to you politely; but, as you are aware, I am _not_ polite.  If you like\n",
      "politeness, you know where to get it.  You have your gentleman-friends,\n",
      "you know, and they’ll serve you with as much of the article as you want.\n",
      "I don’t keep it myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bounderby,’ urged Mr. Gradgrind, ‘we are all liable to mistakes—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought you couldn’t make ’em,’ interrupted Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps I thought so.  But, I say we are all liable to mistakes and I\n",
      "should feel sensible of your delicacy, and grateful for it, if you would\n",
      "spare me these references to Harthouse.  I shall not associate him in our\n",
      "conversation with your intimacy and encouragement; pray do not persist in\n",
      "connecting him with mine.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I never mentioned his name!’ said Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, well!’ returned Mr. Gradgrind, with a patient, even a submissive,\n",
      "air.  And he sat for a little while pondering.  ‘Bounderby, I see reason\n",
      "to doubt whether we have ever quite understood Louisa.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who do you mean by We?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let me say I, then,’ he returned, in answer to the coarsely blurted\n",
      "question; ‘I doubt whether I have understood Louisa.  I doubt whether I\n",
      "have been quite right in the manner of her education.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There you hit it,’ returned Bounderby.  ‘There I agree with you.  You\n",
      "have found it out at last, have you?  Education!  I’ll tell you what\n",
      "education is—To be tumbled out of doors, neck and crop, and put upon the\n",
      "shortest allowance of everything except blows.  That’s what _I_ call\n",
      "education.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think your good sense will perceive,’ Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in\n",
      "all humility, ‘that whatever the merits of such a system may be, it would\n",
      "be difficult of general application to girls.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t see it at all, sir,’ returned the obstinate Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well,’ sighed Mr. Gradgrind, ‘we will not enter into the question.  I\n",
      "assure you I have no desire to be controversial.  I seek to repair what\n",
      "is amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good\n",
      "spirit, Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t understand you, yet,’ said Bounderby, with determined obstinacy,\n",
      "‘and therefore I won’t make any promises.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,’ Mr. Gradgrind\n",
      "proceeded, in the same depressed and propitiatory manner, ‘I appear to\n",
      "myself to have become better informed as to Louisa’s character, than in\n",
      "previous years.  The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and\n",
      "the discovery is not mine.  I think there are—Bounderby, you will be\n",
      "surprised to hear me say this—I think there are qualities in Louisa,\n",
      "which—which have been harshly neglected, and—and a little perverted.\n",
      "And—and I would suggest to you, that—that if you would kindly meet me in\n",
      "a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while—and to\n",
      "encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration—it—it\n",
      "would be the better for the happiness of all of us.  Louisa,’ said Mr.\n",
      "Gradgrind, shading his face with his hand, ‘has always been my favourite\n",
      "child.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on\n",
      "hearing these words, that he seemed to be, and probably was, on the brink\n",
      "of a fit.  With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent\n",
      "up his indignation, however, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’d like to keep her here for a time?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I—I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby, that you should allow\n",
      "Louisa to remain here on a visit, and be attended by Sissy (I mean of\n",
      "course Cecilia Jupe), who understands her, and in whom she trusts.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby, standing up with\n",
      "his hands in his pockets, ‘that you are of opinion that there’s what\n",
      "people call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa,\n",
      "and—and—and almost all the relations in which I have placed her,’ was her\n",
      "father’s sorrowful reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,’ said Bounderby the flushed,\n",
      "confronting him with his legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his\n",
      "pockets, and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was\n",
      "boisterous.  ‘You have said your say; I am going to say mine.  I am a\n",
      "Coketown man.  I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  I know the bricks of\n",
      "this town, and I know the works of this town, and I know the chimneys of\n",
      "this town, and I know the smoke of this town, and I know the Hands of\n",
      "this town.  I know ’em all pretty well.  They’re real.  When a man tells\n",
      "me anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever\n",
      "he is, that I know what he means.  He means turtle soup and venison, with\n",
      "a gold spoon, and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six.\n",
      "That’s what your daughter wants.  Since you are of opinion that she ought\n",
      "to have what she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her.  Because,\n",
      "Tom Gradgrind, she will never have it from me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bounderby,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘I hoped, after my entreaty, you would\n",
      "have taken a different tone.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just wait a bit,’ retorted Bounderby; ‘you have said your say, I\n",
      "believe.  I heard you out; hear me out, if you please.  Don’t make\n",
      "yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency, because,\n",
      "although I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position,\n",
      "I should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that.  Now, there’s\n",
      "an incompatibility of some sort or another, I am given to understand by\n",
      "you, between your daughter and me.  I’ll give _you_ to understand, in\n",
      "reply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the\n",
      "first magnitude—to be summed up in this—that your daughter don’t properly\n",
      "know her husband’s merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as\n",
      "would become her, by George! of the honour of his alliance.  That’s plain\n",
      "speaking, I hope.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bounderby,’ urged Mr. Gradgrind, ‘this is unreasonable.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is it?’ said Bounderby.  ‘I am glad to hear you say so.  Because when\n",
      "Tom Gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what I say is\n",
      "unreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible.  With\n",
      "your permission I am going on.  You know my origin; and you know that for\n",
      "a good many years of my life I didn’t want a shoeing-horn, in consequence\n",
      "of not having a shoe.  Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper,\n",
      "that there are ladies—born ladies—belonging to families—Families!—who\n",
      "next to worship the ground I walk on.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law’s head.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Whereas your daughter,’ proceeded Bounderby, ‘is far from being a born\n",
      "lady.  That you know, yourself.  Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff\n",
      "about such things, for you are very well aware I don’t; but that such is\n",
      "the fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can’t change it.  Why do I say this?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not, I fear,’ observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice, ‘to spare me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hear me out,’ said Bounderby, ‘and refrain from cutting in till your\n",
      "turn comes round.  I say this, because highly connected females have been\n",
      "astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself,\n",
      "and to witness her insensibility.  They have wondered how I have suffered\n",
      "it.  And I wonder myself now, and I won’t suffer it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bounderby,’ returned Mr. Gradgrind, rising, ‘the less we say to-night\n",
      "the better, I think.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, the more we say to-night, the better, I\n",
      "think.  That is,’ the consideration checked him, ‘till I have said all I\n",
      "mean to say, and then I don’t care how soon we stop.  I come to a\n",
      "question that may shorten the business.  What do you mean by the proposal\n",
      "you made just now?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do I mean, Bounderby?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘By your visiting proposition,’ said Bounderby, with an inflexible jerk\n",
      "of the hayfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner,\n",
      "for allowing Louisa a period of repose and reflection here, which may\n",
      "tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility?’ said\n",
      "Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you put it in those terms.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What made you think of this?’ said Bounderby.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have already said, I fear Louisa has not been understood.  Is it\n",
      "asking too much, Bounderby, that you, so far her elder, should aid in\n",
      "trying to set her right?  You have accepted a great charge of her; for\n",
      "better for worse, for—’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to\n",
      "Stephen Blackpool, but he cut the quotation short with an angry start.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come!’ said he, ‘I don’t want to be told about that.  I know what I took\n",
      "her for, as well as you do.  Never you mind what I took her for; that’s\n",
      "my look out.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or\n",
      "less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your\n",
      "part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of\n",
      "true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think differently,’ blustered Bounderby.  ‘I am going to finish this\n",
      "business according to my own opinions.  Now, I don’t want to make a\n",
      "quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind.  To tell you the truth, I don’t\n",
      "think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject.\n",
      "As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes\n",
      "best.  If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don’t fall\n",
      "in my way, I shan’t, for it won’t be worth my while to do it.  As to your\n",
      "daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by\n",
      "leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don’t come home to-morrow, by twelve\n",
      "o’clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I\n",
      "shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you’ll take\n",
      "charge of her for the future.  What I shall say to people in general, of\n",
      "the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this.\n",
      "I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she’s the daughter of\n",
      "Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn’t\n",
      "pull together.  I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I\n",
      "believe; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a\n",
      "woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up\n",
      "to my mark.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, Bounderby,’ urged Mr.\n",
      "Gradgrind, ‘before you commit yourself to such a decision.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I always come to a decision,’ said Bounderby, tossing his hat on: ‘and\n",
      "whatever I do, I do at once.  I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind’s\n",
      "addressing such a remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, knowing what he\n",
      "knows of him, if I could be surprised by anything Tom Gradgrind did,\n",
      "after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug.  I have given you\n",
      "my decision, and I have got no more to say.  Good night!’\n",
      "\n",
      "So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed.  At five minutes\n",

      "in what direction he had been last seen going; he had the whole printed\n",
      "in great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls\n",

      "I had read what’s put in print of Stephen—and what has just as much truth\n",

      "of most people being judged according to the company they keep.  The\n",
      "post-office hasn’t been forgotten either.  What I’ll tell you is, that no\n",
      "letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it.  Therefore, what has\n",

      "‘He hadn’t been gone from here, young lady,’ said Rachael, turning\n",
      "appealingly to Louisa, ‘as much as a week, when he sent me the only\n",

      "another name.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, by George!’ cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, ‘he\n",
      "changes his name, does he!  That’s rather unlucky, too, for such an\n",
      "immaculate chap.  It’s considered a little suspicious in Courts of\n",
      "Justice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many names.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What,’ said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes again, ‘what, young\n",
      "lady, in the name of Mercy, was left the poor lad to do!  The masters\n",
      "against him on one hand, the men against him on the other, he only wantin\n",
      "to work hard in peace, and do what he felt right.  Can a man have no soul\n",
      "of his own, no mind of his own?  Must he go wrong all through wi’ this\n",
      "side, or must he go wrong all through wi’ that, or else be hunted like a\n",
      "hare?’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘He shall not, through any act of mine, come back wi’ the unmerited\n",
      "reproach of being brought back.  He shall come back of his own accord to\n",
      "clear himself, and put all those that have injured his good character,\n",
      "and he not here for its defence, to shame.  I have told him what has been\n",
      "done against him,’ said Rachael, throwing off all distrust as a rock\n",
      "throws off the sea, ‘and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Notwithstanding which,’ added Mr. Bounderby, ‘if he can be laid hold of\n",
      "any sooner, he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself.  As\n",
      "to you, I have nothing against you; what you came and told me turns out\n",
      "to be true, and I have given you the means of proving it to be true, and\n",
      "there’s an end of it.  I wish you good night all!  I must be off to look\n",
      "a little further into this.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby moved, moved with him, kept\n",
      "close to him, and went away with him.  The only parting salutation of\n",
      "which he delivered himself was a sulky ‘Good night, father!’  With a\n",
      "brief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since his sheet-anchor had come home, Mr. Gradgrind had been sparing of\n",
      "speech.  He still sat silent, when Louisa mildly said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It goes against me,’ Rachael answered, in a gentler manner, ‘to mistrust\n",
      "any one; but when I am so mistrusted—when we all are—I cannot keep such\n",
      "things quite out of my mind.  I ask your pardon for having done you an\n",
      "injury.  I don’t think what I said now.  Yet I might come to think it\n",
      "again, wi’ the poor lad so wronged.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did you tell him in your letter,’ inquired Sissy, ‘that suspicion seemed\n",
      "to have fallen upon him, because he had been seen about the Bank at\n",
      "night?  He would then know what he would have to explain on coming back,\n",
      "and would be ready.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, dear,’ she returned; ‘but I can’t guess what can have ever taken\n",
      "him there.  He never used to go there.  It was never in his way.  His way\n",
      "was the same as mine, and not near it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and\n",
      "whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I doubt,’ said Rachael, ‘if he can be here till next day.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then I will come next night too,’ said Sissy.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his\n",
      "head, and said to his daughter:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man.  Do you\n",
      "believe him to be implicated?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.  I do\n",
      "not believe it now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing\n",
      "him to be suspected.  His appearance and manner; are they so honest?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very honest.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And her confidence not to be shaken!  I ask myself,’ said Mr. Gradgrind,\n",
      "musing, ‘does the real culprit know of these accusations?  Where is he?\n",
      "Who is he?’\n",
      "\n",
      "His hair had latterly began to change its colour.  As he leaned upon his\n",
      "hand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity,\n",
      "hurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side.  Her eyes by\n",
      "accident met Sissy’s at the moment.  Sissy flushed and started, and\n",
      "Louisa put her finger on her lip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not\n",
      "come, she told it in a whisper.  Next night again, when she came home\n",
      "with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke\n",
      "in the same low frightened tone.  From the moment of that interchange of\n",
      "looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor\n",
      "ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and\n",
      "Stephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.  On the fourth\n",
      "day, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to\n",
      "have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with\n",
      "his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road,\n",
      "sixty miles away.  Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town\n",
      "looked for Stephen to be brought in next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his\n",
      "shadow, assisting in all the proceedings.  He was greatly excited,\n",
      "horribly fevered, bit his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard\n",

      "were sent in quest of him, and that he would not appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whelp was right.  The messengers returned alone.  Rachael’s letter\n",
      "had gone, Rachael’s letter had been delivered.  Stephen Blackpool had\n",
      "decamped in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him.  The only doubt\n",
      "in Coketown was, whether Rachael had written in good faith, believing\n",
      "that he really would come back, or warning him to fly.  On this point\n",
      "opinion was divided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six days, seven days, far on into another week.  The wretched whelp\n",
      "plucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow defiant.  ‘_Was_ the\n",

      "\n",
      "Every night, Sissy went to Rachael’s lodging, and sat with her in her\n",
      "small neat room.  All day, Rachael toiled as such people must toil,\n",
      "whatever their anxieties.  The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was\n",
      "lost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants,\n",
      "like the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever\n",
      "happened.  Day and night again, day and night again.  The monotony was\n",
      "unbroken.  Even Stephen Blackpool’s disappearance was falling into the\n",

      "machinery in Coketown.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I misdoubt,’ said Rachael, ‘if there is as many as twenty left in all\n",

      "\n",
      "She said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only by the\n",
      "lamp at the street corner.  Sissy had come there when it was already\n",
      "dark, to await her return from work; and they had since sat at the window\n",
      "where Rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to shine on their\n",
      "sorrowful talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If it hadn’t been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to\n",
      "speak to,’ pursued Rachael, ‘times are, when I think my mind would not\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I do believe so,’ returned Sissy, ‘with my whole heart.  I feel so\n",
      "certain, Rachael, that the confidence you hold in yours against all\n",
      "discouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him\n",
      "than if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And I, my dear,’ said Rachel, with a tremble in her voice, ‘have known\n",

      "everything honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and\n",

      "comfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wi’ me when I am not yet\n",
      "free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever\n",

      "Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that Sissy,\n",
      "sitting by her side, was obliged to listen with attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one.  I\n",
      "can’t think who ’tis, I can’t think how or why it may be done, but I\n",
      "mistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way.  I mistrust that\n",
      "by his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself innocent before\n",
      "them all, some one would be confounded, who—to prevent that—has stopped\n",

      "high numbers as I work, and saying over and over again pieces that I knew\n",
      "when I were a child—I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however\n",
      "tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles.  I must get the better\n",
      "of this before bed-time.  I’ll walk home wi’ you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He might fall ill upon the journey back,’ said Sissy, faintly offering a\n",

      "road where he might stop.’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘True,’ was Sissy’s reluctant admission.\n",
      "\n",

      "Her gentle hand adjusted Rachael’s shawl upon her shining black hair in\n",
      "the usual manner of her wearing it, and they went out.  The night being\n",
      "fine, little knots of Hands were here and there lingering at street\n",
      "corners; but it was supper-time with the greater part of them, and there\n",
      "were but few people in the streets.\n",

      "going straight towards it.  Some train had newly arrived in Coketown,\n",
      "which had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scattered a\n",
      "considerable bustle about the town.  Several coaches were rattling before\n",
      "them and behind them as they approached Mr. Bounderby’s, and one of the\n",
      "latter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the\n",

      "\n",
      "‘It’s a coincidence,’ exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the\n",
      "coachman.  ‘It’s a Providence!  Come out, ma’am!’ then said Mrs. Sparsit,\n",
      "to some one inside, ‘come out, or we’ll have you dragged out!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended.  Whom Mrs.\n",
      "Sparsit incontinently collared.\n",

      "‘Leave her alone, everybody!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit, with great energy.\n",
      "‘Let nobody touch her.  She belongs to me.  Come in, ma’am!’ then said\n",

      "The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient\n",

      "stragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that\n",
      "dwelling-house and see the matter out.  But when the phenomenon was\n",
      "enhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over\n",
      "the town with the Bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in,\n",
      "with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to\n",
      "fall upon their heads.  Accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground,\n",
      "consisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some\n",
      "five-and-twenty, closed in after Sissy and Rachael, as they closed in\n",
      "after Mrs. Sparsit and her prize; and the whole body made a disorderly\n",

      "people in front.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I should think it is!’ cried Mrs. Sparsit, exulting.  ‘Fetch Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby.  Stand away, everybody!’  Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling\n",
      "herself up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of entreaty.\n",
      "‘Don’t tell me,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, aloud.  ‘I have told you twenty\n",

      "over to him myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp,\n",
      "with whom he had been holding conference up-stairs.  Mr. Bounderby looked\n",
      "more astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his\n",
      "dining-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, what’s the matter now!’ said he.  ‘Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ explained that worthy woman, ‘I trust it is my good fortune to\n",
      "produce a person you have much desired to find.  Stimulated by my wish to\n",
      "relieve your mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues to\n",
      "the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside,\n",
      "as have been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now\n",
      "present to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring\n",
      "that person with me—I need not say most unwillingly on her part.  It has\n",
      "not been, sir, without some trouble that I have effected this; but\n",
      "trouble in your service is to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold\n",
      "a real gratification.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mrs. Sparsit ceased; for Mr. Bounderby’s visage exhibited an\n",
      "extraordinary combination of all possible colours and expressions of\n",
      "discomfiture, as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed to his view.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, what do you mean by this?’ was his highly unexpected demand, in\n",
      "great warmth.  ‘I ask you, what do you mean by this, Mrs. Sparsit,\n",
      "ma’am?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir!’ exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why don’t you mind your own business, ma’am?’ roared Bounderby.  ‘How\n",
      "dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs?’\n",
      "\n",
      "This allusion to her favourite feature overpowered Mrs. Sparsit.  She sat\n",
      "down stiffly in a chair, as if she were frozen; and with a fixed stare at\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, slowly grated her mittens against one another, as if they\n",
      "were frozen too.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Josiah!’ cried Mrs. Pegler, trembling.  ‘My darling boy!  I am\n",
      "not to blame.  It’s not my fault, Josiah.  I told this lady over and over\n",
      "again, that I knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you, but\n",
      "she would do it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What did you let her bring you for?  Couldn’t you knock her cap off, or\n",

      "\n",
      "‘My own boy!  She threatened me that if I resisted her, I should be\n",
      "brought by constables, and it was better to come quietly than make that\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked in impatient\n",
      "mortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table, while the\n",
      "spectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler’s appeal, and\n",
      "at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed.  Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I am surprised, madam,’ he observed with severity, ‘that in your old age\n",

      "unnatural and inhuman treatment of him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Me_ unnatural!’ cried poor old Mrs. Pegler.  ‘_Me_ inhuman!  To my dear\n",
      "boy?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dear!’ repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Yes; dear in his self-made prosperity,\n",
      "madam, I dare say.  Not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his\n",
      "infancy, and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_I_ deserted my Josiah!’ cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping her hands.  ‘Now,\n",
      "Lord forgive you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal\n",
      "against the memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms before Josiah\n",
      "was born.  May you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the\n",
      "possibility which dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to—to be brought up in\n",
      "the gutter?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Josiah in the gutter!’ exclaimed Mrs. Pegler.  ‘No such a thing, sir.\n",
      "Never!  For shame on you!  My dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to\n",
      "know, that though he come of humble parents, he come of parents that\n",
      "loved him as dear as the best could, and never thought it hardship on\n",
      "themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful, and\n",
      "I’ve his books at home to show it!  Aye, have I!’ said Mrs. Pegler, with\n",
      "indignant pride.  ‘And my dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to know,\n",
      "sir, that after his beloved father died, when he was eight years old, his\n",
      "mother, too, could pinch a bit, as it was her duty and her pleasure and\n",
      "her pride to do it, to help him out in life, and put him ’prentice.  And\n",
      "a steady lad he was, and a kind master he had to lend him a hand, and\n",
      "well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving.  And _I_’ll\n",
      "give you to know, sir—for this my dear boy won’t—that though his mother\n",
      "kept but a little village shop, he never forgot her, but pensioned me on\n",
      "thirty pound a year—more than I want, for I put by out of it—only making\n",

      "about him, and not trouble him.  And I never have, except with looking at\n",
      "him once a year, when he has never knowed it.  And it’s right,’ said poor\n",
      "old Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, ‘that I _should_ keep down\n",
      "in my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a\n",
      "many unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride\n",
      "in my Josiah to myself, and I can love for love’s own sake!  And I am\n",
      "ashamed of you, sir,’ said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, ‘for your slanders and\n",

      "The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of\n",
      "sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently\n",
      "placed in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had\n",
      "never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and\n",
      "larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short.\n",
      "\n",

      "disperse.  I’m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, I\n",

      "those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the\n",
      "subject, will be disappointed—particularly Tom Gradgrind, and he can’t\n",
      "know it too soon.  In reference to the Bank robbery, there has been a\n",
      "mistake made, concerning my mother.  If there hadn’t been\n",

      "Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding the door\n",

      "the Bully of humility, who had built his windy reputation upon lies, and\n",
      "in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if\n",
      "he had advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to\n",

      "\n",
      "THE Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in\n",
      "the morning Sissy and Rachael met, to walk in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the\n",
      "neighbourhood’s too—after the manner of those pious persons who do\n",
      "penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth—it was\n",
      "customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air,\n",
      "which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to\n",
      "get a few miles away by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their\n",
      "lounge in the fields.  Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the\n",
      "smoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about midway\n",
      "between the town and Mr. Bounderby’s retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal,\n",
      "it was green elsewhere, and there were trees to see, and there were larks\n",
      "singing (though it was Sunday), and there were pleasant scents in the\n",
      "air, and all was over-arched by a bright blue sky.  In the distance one\n",
      "way, Coketown showed as a black mist; in another distance hills began to\n",
      "rise; in a third, there was a faint change in the light of the horizon\n",
      "where it shone upon the far-off sea.  Under their feet, the grass was\n",
      "fresh; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it, and speckled it;\n",
      "hedgerows were luxuriant; everything was at peace.  Engines at pits’\n",
      "mouths, and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily\n",
      "labour into the ground, were alike quiet; wheels had ceased for a short\n",
      "space to turn; and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the\n",
      "shocks and noises of another time.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes, sometimes\n",
      "getting over a fragment of a fence so rotten that it dropped at a touch\n",
      "of the foot, sometimes passing near a wreck of bricks and beams overgrown\n",
      "with grass, marking the site of deserted works.  They followed paths and\n",
      "tracks, however slight.  Mounds where the grass was rank and high, and\n",
      "where brambles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were confusedly\n",
      "heaped together, they always avoided; for dismal stories were told in\n",
      "that country of the old pits hidden beneath such indications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was high when they sat down to rest.  They had seen no one, near\n",
      "or distant, for a long time; and the solitude remained unbroken.  ‘It is\n",
      "so still here, Rachael, and the way is so untrodden, that I think we must\n",
      "be the first who have been here all the summer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "As Sissy said it, her eyes were attracted by another of those rotten\n",
      "fragments of fence upon the ground.  She got up to look at it.  ‘And yet\n",
      "I don’t know.  This has not been broken very long.  The wood is quite\n",
      "fresh where it gave way.  Here are footsteps too.—O Rachael!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She ran back, and caught her round the neck.  Rachael had already started\n",
      "up.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is the matter?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know.  There is a hat lying in the grass.’  They went forward\n",
      "together.  Rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot.  She broke into\n",
      "a passion of tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written in his\n",
      "own hand on the inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O the poor lad, the poor lad!  He has been made away with.  He is lying\n",
      "murdered here!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is there—has the hat any blood upon it?’ Sissy faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of\n",
      "violence, inside or out.  It had been lying there some days, for rain and\n",
      "dew had stained it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it\n",
      "had fallen.  They looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could\n",
      "see nothing more.  ‘Rachael,’ Sissy whispered, ‘I will go on a little by\n",
      "myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when\n",
      "Rachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the\n",
      "wide landscape.  Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a\n",
      "black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass.  They sprang back, and fell\n",
      "upon their knees, each hiding her face upon the other’s neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O, my good Lord!  He’s down there!  Down there!’  At first this, and her\n",
      "terrific screams, were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears,\n",
      "by any prayers, by any representations, by any means.  It was impossible\n",
      "to hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have\n",
      "flung herself down the shaft.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these\n",
      "dreadful cries!  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!’\n",
      "\n",
      "By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of\n",
      "such a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her\n",
      "with a tearless face of stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Rachael, Stephen may be living.  You wouldn’t leave him lying maimed at\n",
      "the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to\n",
      "him?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, no, no!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t stir from here, for his sake!  Let me go and listen.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands\n",
      "and knees, and called to him as loud as she could call.  She listened,\n",
      "but no sound replied.  She called again and listened; still no answering\n",
      "sound.  She did this, twenty, thirty times.  She took a little clod of\n",
      "earth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in.  She\n",
      "could not hear it fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago,\n",
      "almost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all\n",
      "round her, seeing no help.  ‘Rachael, we must lose not a moment.  We must\n",
      "go in different directions, seeking aid.  You shall go by the way we have\n",
      "come, and I will go forward by the path.  Tell any one you see, and every\n",
      "one what has happened.  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew by Rachael’s face that she might trust her now.  And after\n",
      "standing for a moment to see her running, wringing her hands as she ran,\n",
      "she turned and went upon her own search; she stopped at the hedge to tie\n",
      "her shawl there as a guide to the place, then threw her bonnet aside, and\n",
      "ran as she had never run before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Run, Sissy, run, in Heaven’s name!  Don’t stop for breath.  Run, run!\n",
      "Quickening herself by carrying such entreaties in her thoughts, she ran\n",
      "from field to field, and lane to lane, and place to place, as she had\n",
      "never run before; until she came to a shed by an engine-house, where two\n",
      "men lay in the shade, asleep on straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "First to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild and breathless as\n",
      "she was, what had brought her there, were difficulties; but they no\n",
      "sooner understood her than their spirits were on fire like hers.  One of\n",
      "the men was in a drunken slumber, but on his comrade’s shouting to him\n",
      "that a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he started out to a pool\n",
      "of dirty water, put his head in it, and came back sober.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further, and with that\n",
      "one to another, while they ran elsewhere.  Then a horse was found; and\n",
      "she got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad, and send a\n",
      "message to Louisa, which she wrote and gave him.  By this time a whole\n",
      "village was up: and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all\n",
      "things necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place,\n",
      "to be carried to the Old Hell Shaft.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man lying in\n",
      "the grave where he had been buried alive.  She could not bear to remain\n",
      "away from it any longer—it was like deserting him—and she hurried swiftly\n",
      "back, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, including the drunken man\n",
      "whom the news had sobered, and who was the best man of all.  When they\n",
      "came to the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she had left it.\n",
      "The men called and listened as she had done, and examined the edge of the\n",
      "chasm, and settled how it had happened, and then sat down to wait until\n",
      "the implements they wanted should come up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every\n",
      "whisper among these men, made Sissy tremble, for she thought it was a cry\n",
      "at the bottom of the pit.  But the wind blew idly over it, and no sound\n",
      "arose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting.\n",
      "After they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the\n",
      "accident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to\n",
      "arrive.  In the midst of this, Rachael returned; and with her party there\n",
      "was a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines.  But, the expectation\n",
      "among the people that the man would be found alive was very slight\n",
      "indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man\n",
      "put himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general\n",
      "consent, and made a large ring round the Old Hell Shaft, and appointed\n",
      "men to keep it.  Besides such volunteers as were accepted to work, only\n",
      "Sissy and Rachael were at first permitted within this ring; but, later in\n",
      "the day, when the message brought an express from Coketown, Mr. Gradgrind\n",
      "and Louisa, and Mr. Bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and Rachael had first sat\n",
      "down upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men to descend\n",
      "securely was rigged with poles and ropes.  Difficulties had arisen in the\n",
      "construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found\n",
      "wanting, and messages had had to go and return.  It was five o’clock in\n",
      "the afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday, before a candle was sent\n",
      "down to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood crowded close\n",
      "together, attentively watching it: the man at the windlass lowering as\n",
      "they were told.  The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and\n",
      "then some water was cast in.  Then the bucket was hooked on; and the\n",
      "sobered man and another got in with lights, giving the word ‘Lower away!’\n",
      "\n",
      "As the rope went out, tight and strained, and the windlass creaked, there\n",
      "was not a breath among the one or two hundred men and women looking on,\n",
      "that came as it was wont to come.  The signal was given and the windlass\n",
      "stopped, with abundant rope to spare.  Apparently so long an interval\n",
      "ensued with the men at the windlass standing idle, that some women\n",
      "shrieked that another accident had happened!  But the surgeon who held\n",
      "the watch, declared five minutes not to have elapsed yet, and sternly\n",
      "admonished them to keep silence.  He had not well done speaking, when the\n",
      "windlass was reversed and worked again.  Practised eyes knew that it did\n",
      "not go as heavily as it would if both workmen had been coming up, and\n",
      "that only one was returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rope came in tight and strained; and ring after ring was coiled upon\n",
      "the barrel of the windlass, and all eyes were fastened on the pit.  The\n",
      "sobered man was brought up and leaped out briskly on the grass.  There\n",
      "was an universal cry of ‘Alive or dead?’ and then a deep, profound hush.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he said ‘Alive!’ a great shout arose and many eyes had tears in\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But he’s hurt very bad,’ he added, as soon as he could make himself\n",
      "heard again.  ‘Where’s doctor?  He’s hurt so very bad, sir, that we donno\n",
      "how to get him up.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They all consulted together, and looked anxiously at the surgeon, as he\n",
      "asked some questions, and shook his head on receiving the replies.  The\n",
      "sun was setting now; and the red light in the evening sky touched every\n",
      "face there, and caused it to be distinctly seen in all its rapt suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consultation ended in the men returning to the windlass, and the\n",
      "pitman going down again, carrying the wine and some other small matters\n",
      "with him.  Then the other man came up.  In the meantime, under the\n",
      "surgeon’s directions, some men brought a hurdle, on which others made a\n",
      "thick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw, while he himself\n",
      "contrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs.  As\n",
      "these were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last\n",
      "come up, with instructions how to use them: and as he stood, shown by the\n",
      "light he carried, leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the poles,\n",
      "and sometimes glancing down the pit, and sometimes glancing round upon\n",
      "the people, he was not the least conspicuous figure in the scene.  It was\n",
      "dark now, and torches were kindled.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared from the little this man said to those about him, which was\n",
      "quickly repeated all over the circle, that the lost man had fallen upon a\n",
      "mass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was half choked up, and that\n",
      "his fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the side.  He\n",
      "lay upon his back with one arm doubled under him, and according to his\n",
      "own belief had hardly stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his\n",
      "free hand to a side pocket, in which he remembered to have some bread and\n",
      "meat (of which he had swallowed crumbs), and had likewise scooped up a\n",
      "little water in it now and then.  He had come straight away from his\n",
      "work, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on\n",
      "his way to Mr. Bounderby’s country house after dark, when he fell.  He\n",
      "was crossing that dangerous country at such a dangerous time, because he\n",
      "was innocent of what was laid to his charge, and couldn’t rest from\n",
      "coming the nearest way to deliver himself up.  The Old Hell Shaft, the\n",
      "pitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the\n",
      "last; for though Stephen could speak now, he believed it would soon be\n",
      "found to have mangled the life out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all was ready, this man, still taking his last hurried charges from\n",
      "his comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him,\n",
      "disappeared into the pit.  The rope went out as before, the signal was\n",
      "made as before, and the windlass stopped.  No man removed his hand from\n",
      "it now.  Every one waited with his grasp set, and his body bent down to\n",
      "the work, ready to reverse and wind in.  At length the signal was given,\n",
      "and all the ring leaned forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, now, the rope came in, tightened and strained to its utmost as it\n",
      "appeared, and the men turned heavily, and the windlass complained.  It\n",
      "was scarcely endurable to look at the rope, and think of its giving way.\n",
      "But, ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass safely,\n",
      "and the connecting chains appeared, and finally the bucket with the two\n",
      "men holding on at the sides—a sight to make the head swim, and oppress\n",
      "the heart—and tenderly supporting between them, slung and tied within,\n",
      "the figure of a poor, crushed, human creature.\n",
      "\n",
      "A low murmur of pity went round the throng, and the women wept aloud, as\n",
      "this form, almost without form, was moved very slowly from its iron\n",
      "deliverance, and laid upon the bed of straw.  At first, none but the\n",
      "surgeon went close to it.  He did what he could in its adjustment on the\n",
      "couch, but the best that he could do was to cover it.  That gently done,\n",
      "he called to him Rachael and Sissy.  And at that time the pale, worn,\n",
      "patient face was seen looking up at the sky, with the broken right hand\n",
      "lying bare on the outside of the covering garments, as if waiting to be\n",
      "taken by another hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gave him drink, moistened his face with water, and administered some\n",
      "drops of cordial and wine.  Though he lay quite motionless looking up at\n",
      "the sky, he smiled and said, ‘Rachael.’  She stooped down on the grass at\n",
      "his side, and bent over him until her eyes were between his and the sky,\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Rachael, my dear.’\n",

      "BEFORE the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was broken, one figure\n",

      "stood near Louisa, who held her father’s arm, but in a retired place by\n",
      "themselves.  When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to the couch, Sissy,\n",
      "attentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked shadow—a sight\n",
      "in the horror of his face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but\n",
      "one—and whispered in his ear.  Without turning his head, he conferred\n",
      "with her a few moments, and vanished.  Thus the whelp had gone out of the\n",
      "circle before the people moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the father reached home, he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby’s,\n",
      "desiring his son to come to him directly.  The reply was, that Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I believe, father,’ said Louisa, ‘he will not come back to town\n",

      "\n",
      "In the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was\n",
      "opened, and seeing his son’s place empty (he had not the courage to look\n",
      "in at first) went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way\n",
      "there.  To whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but\n",
      "entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ\n",
      "his son at a distance for a little while.  Also, that he was charged with\n",
      "the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool’s memory, and declaring the\n",
      "thief.  Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street\n",
      "after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that\n",

      "it, ‘Not now, my dears; in the evening.’  On their return in the evening,\n",
      "he said, ‘I am not able yet—to-morrow.’  He ate nothing all day, and had\n",

      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took\n",
      "his usual place at the table.  Aged and bent he looked, and quite bowed\n",
      "down; and yet he looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days\n",
      "when in this life he wanted nothing—but Facts.  Before he left the room,\n",
      "he appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head\n",

      "‘The poor man being about to leave the town, it came into his evil brain\n",

      "\n",
      "‘He took him out of the room.  I asked him afterwards, why he had done\n",
      "so, and he made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and\n",
      "when I remember the circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine\n",
      "too truly what passed between them.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let me know,’ said her father, ‘if your thoughts present your guilty\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I fear, father,’ hesitated Louisa, ‘that he must have made some\n",
      "representation to Stephen Blackpool—perhaps in my name, perhaps in his\n",
      "own—which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never\n",
      "done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Too plain!’ returned the father.  ‘Too plain!’\n",

      "could not effect it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sissy has effected it, father.’\n",

      "\n",
      "‘We had our fears,’ Sissy explained, glancing at Louisa, ‘before\n",
      "yesterday; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last\n",
      "night, and heard what passed (being close to Rachael all the time), I\n",
      "went to him when no one saw, and said to him, “Don’t look at me.  See\n",
      "where your father is.  Escape at once, for his sake and your own!”  He\n",
      "was in a tremble before I whispered to him, and he started and trembled\n",
      "more then, and said, “Where can I go?  I have very little money, and I\n",
      "don’t know who will hide me!”  I thought of father’s old circus.  I have\n",
      "not forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year, and I read of\n",
      "him in a paper only the other day.  I told him to hurry there, and tell\n",
      "his name, and ask Mr. Sleary to hide him till I came.  “I’ll get to him\n",
      "before the morning,” he said.  And I saw him shrink away among the\n",
      "people.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank Heaven!’ exclaimed his father.  ‘He may be got abroad yet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had directed him was\n",
      "within three hours’ journey of Liverpool, whence he could be swiftly\n",
      "dispatched to any part of the world.  But, caution being necessary in\n",
      "communicating with him—for there was a greater danger every moment of his\n",
      "being suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a Roman\n",
      "part—it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in\n",
      "question, by a circuitous course, alone; and that the unhappy father,\n",
      "setting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same\n",
      "bourne by another and wider route.  It was further agreed that he should\n",
      "not present himself to Mr. Sleary, lest his intentions should be\n",
      "mistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to\n",
      "take flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to Sissy and\n",
      "Louisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery\n",
      "and disgrace, of his father’s being at hand and of the purpose for which\n",
      "they had come.  When these arrangements had been well considered and were\n",
      "fully understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into\n",
      "execution.  Early in the afternoon, Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from his\n",
      "own house into the country, to be taken up on the line by which he was to\n",
      "travel; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different\n",
      "course, encouraged by not seeing any face they knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two travelled all night, except when they were left, for odd numbers\n",
      "of minutes, at branch-places, up illimitable flights of steps, or down\n",
      "wells—which was the only variety of those branches—and, early in the\n",
      "morning, were turned out on a swamp, a mile or two from the town they\n",
      "sought.  From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old\n",
      "postilion, who happened to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly: and so\n",
      "were smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs lived:\n",
      "which, although not a magnificent or even savoury approach, was, as is\n",
      "usual in such cases, the legitimate highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of\n",
      "Sleary’s Circus.  The company had departed for another town more than\n",
      "twenty miles off, and had opened there last night.  The connection\n",
      "between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road, and the travelling\n",
      "on that road was very slow.  Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and\n",
      "no rest (which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious\n",
      "circumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of\n",
      "Sleary’s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o’clock when they\n",
      "stopped in the market-place.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that very hour,\n",
      "was in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon\n",
      "the stones of the street.  Sissy recommended that, to avoid making\n",
      "inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present\n",
      "themselves to pay at the door.  If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he\n",
      "would be sure to know her, and would proceed with discretion.  If he were\n",
      "not, he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what he had done\n",
      "with the fugitive, would proceed with discretion still.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well-remembered\n",
      "booth.  The flag with the inscription SLEARY’S HORSE-RIDING was there;\n",
      "and the Gothic niche was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there.  Master\n",
      "Kidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest\n",
      "credulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the invincible force of\n",
      "circumstances (and his beard), and, in the capacity of a man who made\n",
      "himself generally useful, presided on this occasion over the\n",
      "exchequer—having also a drum in reserve, on which to expend his leisure\n",
      "moments and superfluous forces.  In the extreme sharpness of his look out\n",
      "for base coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw\n",
      "anything but money; so Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they went in.\n",

      "Royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his\n",
      "reign was peaceful.  Miss Josephine Sleary, in her celebrated graceful\n",
      "Equestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown (who\n",
      "humorously said Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary appeared, leading her\n",
      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long whip-lash,\n",
      "and the Clown had only said, ‘If you do it again, I’ll throw the horse at\n",
      "you!’ when Sissy was recognised both by father and daughter.  But they\n",
      "got through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving\n",
      "for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive\n",
      "eye than into his fixed one.  The performance seemed a little long to\n",
      "Sissy and Louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an\n",
      "opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary (who said ‘Indeed, sir!’ to all his\n",
      "observations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two\n",
      "legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs,\n",
      "and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs,\n",
      "and threw ’em at four legs, who ran away with one leg.  For, although an\n",
      "ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog,\n",
      "and a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great\n",
      "suspense.  At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her\n",
      "curtsey amid great applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had\n",
      "just warmed himself, and said, ‘Now _I_’ll have a turn!’ when Sissy was\n",
      "touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out.\n",

      "‘since you ask me what motive I have in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom\n",
      "back to Coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know.  I have\n",
      "suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first.  I had had\n",
      "my eye upon him before that time, for I knew his ways.  I have kept my\n",
      "observations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs\n",
      "against him now, besides his running away, and besides his own\n",
      "confession, which I was just in time to overhear.  I had the pleasure of\n",
      "watching your house yesterday morning, and following you here.  I am\n",
      "going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him\n",
      "over to Mr. Bounderby.  Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby\n",
      "will then promote me to young Mr. Tom’s situation.  And I wish to have\n",
      "his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.’\n",

      "‘I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,’ returned Bitzer; ‘but I am\n",
      "sure you know that the whole social system is a question of\n",
      "self-interest.  What you must always appeal to, is a person’s\n",
      "self-interest.  It’s your only hold.  We are so constituted.  I was\n",

      "paid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that\n",
      "everything was to be paid for.  Nobody was ever on any account to give\n",
      "anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase.  Gratitude was\n",
      "to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be.  Every\n",
      "inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a\n",
      "bargain across a counter.  And if we didn’t get to Heaven that way, it\n",
      "was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t deny,’ added Bitzer, ‘that my schooling was cheap.  But that\n",

      "IT is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain\n",
      "blusterer, before the vain blusterer sees it himself.  Mr. Bounderby felt\n",
      "that Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously anticipated him, and presumed to be\n",
      "wiser than he.  Inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant\n",
      "discovery of Mrs. Pegler, he turned this presumption, on the part of a\n",
      "woman in her dependent position, over and over in his mind, until it\n",
      "accumulated with turning like a great snowball.  At last he made the\n",
      "discovery that to discharge this highly connected female—to have it in\n",
      "his power to say, ‘She was a woman of family, and wanted to stick to me,\n",
      "but I wouldn’t have it, and got rid of her’—would be to get the utmost\n",
      "possible amount of crowning glory out of the connection, and at the same\n",
      "time to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her deserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Filled fuller than ever, with this great idea, Mr. Bounderby came in to\n",
      "lunch, and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days, where his\n",
      "portrait was.  Mrs. Sparsit sat by the fire, with her foot in her cotton\n",
      "stirrup, little thinking whither she was posting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered her pity for Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and contrition.  In virtue\n",
      "thereof, it had become her habit to assume a woful look, which woful look\n",
      "she now bestowed upon her patron.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What’s the matter now, ma’am?’ said Mr. Bounderby, in a very short,\n",
      "rough way.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pray, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit, ‘do not bite my nose off.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bite your nose off, ma’am?’ repeated Mr. Bounderby.  ‘_Your_ nose!’\n",
      "meaning, as Mrs. Sparsit conceived, that it was too developed a nose for\n",
      "the purpose.  After which offensive implication, he cut himself a crust\n",
      "of bread, and threw the knife down with a noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said, ‘Mr. Bounderby,\n",
      "sir!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, ma’am?’ retorted Mr. Bounderby.  ‘What are you staring at?’\n",

      "morning?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, ma’am.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘May I inquire, sir,’ pursued the injured woman, ‘whether _I_ am the\n",
      "unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, I’ll tell you what, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘I am not come here to\n",
      "be bullied.  A female may be highly connected, but she can’t be permitted\n",
      "to bother and badger a man in my position, and I am not going to put up\n",
      "with it.’  (Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on: foreseeing that if\n",
      "he allowed of details, he would be beaten.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her Coriolanian eyebrows;\n",
      "gathered up her work into its proper basket; and rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sir,’ said she, majestically.  ‘It is apparent to me that I am in your\n",
      "way at present.  I will retire to my own apartment.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Allow me to open the door, ma’am.’\n",

      "‘You had better allow me, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, passing her, and\n",
      "getting his hand upon the lock; ‘because I can take the opportunity of\n",
      "saying a word to you, before you go.  Mrs. Sparsit, ma’am, I rather think\n",
      "you are cramped here, do you know?  It appears to me, that, under my\n",
      "humble roof, there’s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in\n",
      "other people’s affairs.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great\n",
      "politeness, ‘Really, sir?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have\n",
      "happened, ma’am,’ said Bounderby; ‘and it appears to my poor judgment—’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh!  Pray, sir,’ Mrs. Sparsit interposed, with sprightly cheerfulness,\n",
      "‘don’t disparage your judgment.  Everybody knows how unerring Mr.\n",
      "Bounderby’s judgment is.  Everybody has had proofs of it.  It must be the\n",
      "theme of general conversation.  Disparage anything in yourself but your\n",
      "judgment, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It appears to me, ma’am, I say, that a different sort of establishment\n",
      "altogether would bring out a lady of _your_ powers.  Such an\n",
      "establishment as your relation, Lady Scadgers’s, now.  Don’t you think\n",
      "you might find some affairs there, ma’am, to interfere with?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It never occurred to me before, sir,’ returned Mrs. Sparsit; ‘but now\n",
      "you mention it, should think it highly probable.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then suppose you try, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, laying an envelope with a\n",
      "cheque in it in her little basket.  ‘You can take your own time for\n",
      "going, ma’am; but perhaps in the meanwhile, it will be more agreeable to\n",
      "a lady of your powers of mind, to eat her meals by herself, and not to be\n",
      "intruded upon.  I really ought to apologise to you—being only Josiah\n",
      "Bounderby of Coketown—for having stood in your light so long.’\n",
      "\n",

      "could speak, sir—but it has the advantage over the original of not\n",
      "possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others,—it would\n",
      "testify, that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually\n",
      "addressed it as the picture of a Noodle.  Nothing that a Noodle does, can\n",
      "awaken surprise or indignation; the proceedings of a Noodle can only\n",
      "inspire contempt.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her Roman features like a medal struck to\n",
      "commemorate her scorn of Mr. Bounderby, surveyed him fixedly from head to\n",
      "foot, swept disdainfully past him, and ascended the staircase.  Mr.\n",

      "about the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a\n",

      "rising young man, so devoted to his master’s great merits, who had won\n",
      "young Tom’s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the\n",
