      "In the height of his boisterous merriment, Mr Quilp, having on some pretence dismissed his attendant sprite for the moment, resumed his usual manner all at once, dismounted from his cask, and laid his hand upon the lawyer’s sleeve.\n",

      "The faculty don’t consider it a healthy custom, I believe, Mr Richard, to carry one’s handkerchief in one’s hat--I have heard that it keeps the head too warm--but in every other point of view, its being there, is extremely satisfactory--extremely so.’An exclamation, at once from Richard Swiveller, Miss Sally, and Kit himself, cut the lawyer short.\n",
      "But,’added Mr Brass with greater fortitude, ‘ I am myself a lawyer, and bound to set an example in carrying the laws of my happy country into effect.\n",
      "‘ Why not, you rogue of a lawyer, why not?\n",
      "’ murmured the lawyer, standing on tiptoe, and endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of what was passing inside, which at that distance was impossible--‘ drinking, I suppose,--making himself more fiery and furious, and heating his malice and mischievousness till they boil.\n",
