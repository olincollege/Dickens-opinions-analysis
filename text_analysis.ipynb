the humbler beer-shop; and the village tradesman’s; then the lawyer’s and the parson’s, at whose dread names the beer-shop trembled; the church then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees; then there were a few more cottages; then the cage, and pound, and not unfrequently, on a bank by the way-side, a deep old dusty well.', '’ laughed the lawyer in an affected ecstasy.', 'Be quick and open the door, or if there’s another lawyer near and he should happen to look out of window, he’ll snap him up before your eyes, he will.’It is probable that the loss of the phoenix of clerks, even to a rival practitioner, would not have broken Mr Brass’s heart; but, pretending great alacrity, he rose from his seat, and going to the door, returned, introducing his client, who led by the hand no less a person than Mr Richard Swiveller.', 'You’re joking, sir, you’re joking with me,’replied the lawyer, putting on his hat.', '‘ I’m glad of it,’returned the single gentleman;

we can temper it, if I may say so, to the shorn lambs.’‘ Shorn indeed!', '‘ From--’ ‘ No matter about the person they came from,’replied the lawyer.', '‘ I have been thinking, Kit,’said the lawyer, ‘ that I could throw some little emoluments in your mother’s way--You have a mother, I think?', '‘ Upon my word, Mr Richard, Sir,’replied the lawyer, feeling in all his pockets with looks of the greatest agitation, ‘ I fear this is a black business.', 'The faculty don’t consider it a healthy custom, I believe, Mr Richard, to carry one’s handkerchief in one’s hat--I have heard that it keeps the head too warm--but in every other point of view, its being there, is extremely satisfactory--extremely so.’An exclamation, at once from Richard Swiveller, Miss Sally, and Kit himself, cut the lawyer short.', 'But,’added Mr Brass with greater fortitude, ‘ I am myself a lawyer, and bound to set an example in carrying the laws of my happy country into effect.', '‘ Why not, you rogue of a lawyer, why not?', '’ murmured the lawyer, standing on tiptoe, and endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of what was passing inside, which at that distance was impossible--‘ drinking, I suppose,--making himself more fiery and furious, and heating his malice and mischievousness till they boil.', '’ Quilp had slily shaded the light by holding it against his breast, and now stood chuckling and shaking from head to foot in a rapture of delight, as he heard the lawyer stumbling up the yard, and now and then falling heavily down.']\n",
